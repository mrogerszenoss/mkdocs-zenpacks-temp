## Scrutinizer NetFlow & sFlow Analyzer ZenPack

The Scrutinizer ZenPack provides direct integration between Zenoss and
Scrutinizer.

## Support

This ZenPack is developed by the Zenoss user community and supported via
our online forums. Zenoss, Inc. does not provide direct support for this
ZenPack.

## Background

The Scrutinizer ZenPack provides direct integration between Zenoss and
Scrutinizer. This integration allows network engineers to quickly switch
between viewing the event details in Zenoss and the detailed network
traffic analysis view in Scrutinizer. Network engineers need to quickly
find and resolve network performance bottlenecks before they impact
customers and end-users. One of the most effective ways to diagnose
network performance problems is by analyzing NetFlow data.
