## Background

This ZenPack monitors Veritas Netbackup Client Image Sizes. Zenoss goes
to the device and attempt to execute the netbackup client image list
command provided by the Veritas Netbackup Client. This will then pull
the Size and Files fields for a given Netbackup Profile. By default the
Size of the backup image is charted and can be used to alert on
failures. Please refer to the author's attached documentation for
further details.
