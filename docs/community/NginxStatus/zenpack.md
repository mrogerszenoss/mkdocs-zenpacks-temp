## Background

[Nginx](http://nginx.org){.external-link} is a great lit­tle web server.
I have posted pre­vi­ously about using it as a reverse proxy. Whether
you're using it as a reverse proxy or as a nor­mal web server you will
prob­a­bly even­tu­ally want to know what its doing over time so you can
adjust resources as necessary.

The other day I threw together a ZenPack to make it eas­ier to setup
mon­i­tor­ing on new Zenoss instances. It con­tains a com­mand data
source &ldquo;check_nginx_ng&rdquo; which is a slightly mod­i­fied ver­sion of Chris
Kelly's check_nginx_ng which in turn was based on check_nginx by Mike
Adolphs. So thanks to them for doing the major­ity of the work! If your
inter­ested you can pick it up over on GitHub.
