## Background

Provides monitoring and graphing for FreeRADIUS statistics. Currently
total Access, Authentication and Accounting metrics are graphed, as well
as the rate per 5 minute polling interval for each.

You will want to edit the data source to reflect your environment.
Change "radclient localhost:18120 status adminsecret" to the port and
administrator secret for your FreeRADIUS status server. See
<http://wiki.freeradius.org/config/Status> for more information.

A new Monitoring Template named "FreeRADIUS" will be created.

Requires SSH credentials setup to run the commands.
