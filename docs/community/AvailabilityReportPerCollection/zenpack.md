## Availability Report Per Collection ZenPack

This ZenPack extends Juerg Gerber's Availability Per Group Report,
adding support for additional organizers. You can now specify Group,
System, Location and Device Class, in addition to the standard event
availability report. Both device id and title are output. A sample
reportmail script is provided in the libexec directory to directly email
reports.

The 1.4.0 version is a major update and is based on code from Zenoss
4.2.5 SUP 671.

There are 2 branches; master outputs all fields; the title branch just
outputs id, title, link and availability.

## Support

This ZenPack is developed by the Zenoss user community and supported via
