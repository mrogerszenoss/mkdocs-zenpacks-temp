## Background

This ZenPack provides a "Web Transaction" component and allows for the
execution of Twill-based scripts within Zenoss

Each "Web Transaction" component has a "script" property that contains
the script contents, which should be pasted into the "script" textarea
field of the "details" pane for the component.

Essentially this is an updated version of the "Synthetic Web
Transactions" ZenPack by Sonny Stormes
