## Releases

Version 1.7- [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.zenAppProfiler/1.7/ZenPacks.community.zenAppProfiler-1.7.egg){.external-link}:   **Summary of changes:** Substantial rewrite to use python 'sets'
    over previous logic, as well as some change to overall structure and
    function...hopefully it's now simpler, easier to use, and more
    predictable. Import and Export scripts are now included, but I don't
    believe they'll work with previous versions.
:   Compatible with Zenoss Core 3.2.x, Zenoss Resource Manager 4.1.x
