## Background

This ZenPack leverages the libvirt API for monitoring virtualization
servers (e.g. XEN, KVM, etc...). This uses the system python and libvirt
python API to monitor various virtualization platforms remotely. It
provides a **/Server libvirtHost** device class and this module is
tested using ssh as a transport for the libvirt API, it could be made to
use TLS or TCP with further development. It provides a
**libvirtvirtualHostlist** report as well.
