## MySQL SSH Monitor ZenPack

This Monitoring ZenPack provides SSH-based monitoring of MySQL
databases.

## Support

This ZenPack is developed by the Zenoss user community and supported via
our online forums. Zenoss, Inc. does not provide direct support for this
ZenPack.

## Releases

Version 0.4- [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.MySQLSSH/0.4/ZenPacks.community.MySQLSSH-0.4.egg){.external-link}:   Compatible with Zenoss Core 2.5.x, Zenoss Core 3.1.x, Zenoss Core
    3.2.x

## Background

This Monitoring ZenPack provides SSH-based monitoring of MySQL
databases. It was based off of the Core MySql Monitor ZenPack which
requires port 3306 to be remotely accessible. Rather than use remote
access, this ZenPack connects to the MySQL server and performs the same
SQL queries locally. All other features of the ZenPack are identical to
the original. Please refer to the Zenoss Extended Monitoring Guide for
configuration requirements.
