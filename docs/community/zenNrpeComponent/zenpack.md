## Background

This ZenPack wraps the "check_nrpe" Nagios plugin such that it is
treated as a device component, using standard GUI component management
methods.

The component properties specify the remote command plugin to be called.
The "arglist" is a newline-delimited list of arguments to be passed to
the remote NRPE daemon (assuming it is configured properly to receive
them).
