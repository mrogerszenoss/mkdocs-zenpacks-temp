## Background

When troubleshooting network issues, it can be very useful to have all
the interface graphs for a device on the same screen. This helps with
spotting trends, or tracing where traffic is flowing through a switch or
router. The only way to natively achieve this with Zenoss is to create a
graph or multi-graph report for every network device manually, which can
be a chore if you have more than a few network devices.
