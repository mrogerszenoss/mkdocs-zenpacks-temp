## Background

Provides support for Olson Power meters gathering performance
information for voltage, current, power, energy and temperature. These
are rather minimal devices that only support a very small subset of SNMP
MIB-2. They also deliver performance data as strings rather than in a
numeric format so a command script is used to gather and convert data.
