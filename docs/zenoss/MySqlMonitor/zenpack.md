## Background

This ZenPack provides monitoring for MySQL 5.5 and later. Monitoring for
the following MySQL entities is provided using
`twisted.enterprise.adbapi` asynchronous framework. See the Usage
section for details.

Please restart zenoss after installing this ZenPack. Note that the
commercial zenoss version requires *ZenPacks.zenoss.Impact*, otherwise
the *DynamicServices* panel will be missing.

## Features

The features added by this ZenPack can be summarized as follows. They
are each detailed further below.

-   Discovery of MySQL entities.
-   Monitoring of MySQL Server and Database components.
-   Event management and monitoring for certain MySQL states.
-   Optional service impact with addition of Zenoss Service Dynamics
    product.

### Discovery

The following entities will be discovered through
*zMySQLConnectionString* property you provide. The attributes, tags and
collections will be updated on Zenoss' normal remodeling interval which
defaults to every 12 hours.

Servers:

-   *Attributes*: Percentage of full table scans, Slave status, Master
    status, Number of databases
-   *Tags*: Name
-   *Collections*: Databases

Databases:

-   Attributes: Number of tables, Default character set, Default
    collation
-   Tags: Name

Note that all the discovered values for the attributes above are shown
as of the last modeling time.

### Monitoring

The following metrics will be collected every 5 minutes by default. The
*Average* statistic is collected, and the graphed value is per second
for anything that resembles a rate.

Server:

### Event monitoring

According to the following MySQL states this ZenPack will trigger events
with an appropriate summary message.

Device:   Critical event:

    -   Invalid *zMySQLConnectionString* property,
    -   Access denied for user with credentials provided in
        *zMySQLConnectionString* property.

Service:   Error event:

    -   Slave error,
    -   MySQL server is not accessible.

:   Info event:

    -   A database was dropped.

Database:   Warning event:

    -   A table was dropped.

:   Info event:

    -   A table was added.
    -   InnoDB Deadlock occurred.

### Service Impact

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack
adds built-in service impact capability for MySQL. The following service
impact relationships are automatically added. These will be included in
any services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned
entities.

Service Impact Relationships

-   Device failure impacts the Server component.
-   MySQL Server component impacts Database components.

## Usage

To start monitoring your MySQL server you will need to setup connection
to it as well as bind monitoring templates and modeler plugin to the
device or device class containing your MySQL servers.

Use the following steps to start monitoring MySQL using the Zenoss web
interface.

1.  Navigate to the *Configuration Properties* page of the device
    containing your MySQL servers (see 1).
2.  Set user name, password and port in the appropriate fields of
    *zMySQLConnectionString* property (see 2). For non-root users please
    make sure to grant all privileges to avoid access denied errors.
    Note that user name is required.
3.  Navigate to the *Modeler plugins* page of the device containing your
    MySQL servers, add the *MySQLCollector* modeler plugin and remodel
    the device. This will automatically find the MySQL servers and
    databases and begin monitoring them immediately for the previously
    mentioned metrics.

As the custom widget for MySQL credentials is not compatible with Zenoss
4.1, the *zMySQLConnectionString* property in this version should be set
as a valid JSON list (e.g. ''\[{"user": "root", "passwd": "", "port": "3306"}\] '')

Monitoring busy MySQL servers affects *zenpython* daemon. You may change
*zMySqlTimeout* property to specify how long it should wait for response
from MySQL server.

Legacy method

The latest version of ZenPack uses *zenpython* daemon for monitoring and
automatically binds monitoring templates to MySQL components. However,
if you are inclined to use the legacy method for MySQL monitoring
(v2.2.0), you should:

1.  Bind the device-level monitoring template *MySQL /Server* to the
    target device.
2.  Set *zMySqlUsername*, *zMySqlPassword* and *zMySqlPort*
    configuration properties (if the credentials are not valid or not
    set, you will receive the event with in 'App/MySQL' event class).
3.  Make sure that *zencommand* daemon is running.

## Prerequisites

If you are using the commercial zenoss version and *zends*, please make
sure to create a symbolic link by executing the following command:

> > > ln -s /var/lib/zends/zends.sock /tmp/mysql.sock

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with Zenpack installation, please make sure
that you have restarted zenoss after installation and your target disk
has enough free memory and read permissions enabled.

In case of any issues when uninstalling this Zenpack, please remove all
components first. Note that device monitoring requires *zenpython*
daemon to be constantly running.

If you have just enabled monitoring, try pressing *Zoom in* to see the
graphs. In case of any issues you can run zenpython daemon in foreground
with `zenpython run -v10 -c` command and check if there are no
exceptions. If zenpython runs without errors and prints monitoring data
to stdout, then you should check if monitoring templates are bound to
the components.

In case device modeling fails:

-   make sure, that you have specified a correct user, password and port
    to your MySQL user account;
-   grant privileges (see [MySQL GRANT Syntax](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html){.external-link})
    to non-root users to avoid access denied errors by executing the
    following command. REPLICATION CLIENT privilege is needed to
    retrieve MySQL Replication data.

> > > GRANT SELECT, REPLICATION CLIENT ON \*.\* TO 'username'@'%' WITH
> > > GRANT OPTION;

Change '%' to 'localhost' in the statement above if you are modeling the
local MySQL server.

-   check if firewall allows connections on mysql port;
-   ensure that you are able to connect from zenoss server to target
    MySQL server instance by executing the following from the command
    line:

> > > mysql -h -u -p -P

Note that the query `select host from mysql.user` should have an entry
'%' for 'host' field to ensure the remote connection.

## Migration

When migrating from MySqlMonitor ZenPack v2.2.0, you should:

-   Install the new version of the ZP;
-   Restart Zenoss Services;
-   Make sure to leave the old version in place during the install
    process. The new *zMySQLConnectionString* property will be
    constructed using MySQL credentials from older ZenPack version;
-   Bind the modeler plugin as described in the *Usage* section;
-   Model the device components;
-   Remove the old monitoring template (*MySQL /Server*) from the
    device.

Due to different mechanisms of MySQL monitoring, it is not possible to
migrate the old RRD data from the previous version of ZenPack. The Graph
data will remain and will be updated until the user manually removes the
*MySQL /Server* monitoring template.
