## Background

The Calculated Performance ZenPack provides a few capabilities for
creating derived datapoints. A derived datapoint's value is determined
based on the values of other datapoints or attributes, as opposed to
being collected directly from a target device or component. There are
two different types of derived datapoint provided: *Calculated
Performance* and *Datapoint Aggregator*. Both of these types are
collected within the zenpython daemon provided by PythonCollector, so no
new daemons are required.

@lb[](img/zenpack-calculation_basic.png)

Calculated Performance datapoints are functionally the same as in v1.x.
By configuring a Python expression, you can combine any datapoints or
model attributes from the target device or component. The capabilities
of the Python expression have been expanded in v2.0.

@lb[](img/zenpack-aggregation_basic_diagram.png)

Datapoint Aggregator datapoints are a new capability in v2.0. They
perform a point-in-time aggregation of any other datapoint on a set of
target elements. The target elements in question can be any elements in
the Zenoss system that have datapoints associated with them. This is not
limited by type, Device Class, or containing device, though it is
limited to elements collected on the same physical collector as the
aggregating element. An aggregation can be any n-ary commutative
mathematical operation, such as sum, maximum, or standard deviation.
Most aggregations give results in the same units as the input.

## Usage

### Calculated Performance Datasource

A Calculated Performance datasource contains a Python expression whose
result will be stored as the value of the single datapoint. The
expression can reference any other datapoint or model attribute on the
device or component. For example, the expression
`(hw.totalMemory â€“ memAvailReal) / hw.totalMemory` uses the totalMemory
attribute modeled from the device and the datapoint memAvailReal to
calculate a percentage used. Dotted-name model attributes can reference
functions or relationships as long as they take no arguments.

The expression can reference datapoints using any of the following
syntaxes. Replace *dsname* with the name of your datasource and *dpname*
with the name of your datapoint.

1.  `dpname`: This option is the simplest if you know that your
    datapoint name is unique for the device or component to which it's
    bound, and the datapoint name is a valid Python variable name (i.e.
    it contains no hyphens.)
2.  `dsname_dpname`: This option should be used if there's a chance that
    your datapoint name is not unique for the device or component. Using
    the datasource name's then an underscore as a prefix guarantees
    uniqueness. This option requires that both the datasource and
    datapoint name be valid Python variables names. Support for this
    syntax was added in version 1.0.7.
3.  `datapoint['dpname']`: This option can be used if the datapoint's
    name is not a valid Python variable name and the datapoint is unique
    for the device or component to which it's bound. Support for this
    syntax was added in version 2.0.3.
4.  `datapoint['dsname_dpname']`: This is the most verbose, but safest
    option. It can be used when the datapoint name is not unique, and
    either the datasource or datapoint name is not a valid Python
    variables name. Support for this syntax was added in version 2.0.3.

If there are model attributes and datapoints that have a name conflict,
the datapoint's value will be used. To disambiguate, you can use
*here.attribute* to specify a model attribute, and the *dsname_dpname*
name to specify a datapoint.

In v2.0, the capabilities of the expression have been expanded. Any
*eval*-able Python code can be used, including control structures and
any built-in functions, as long as it returns a single numeric value.
This means that any Python keyword (See:
\[\[https://docs.python.org/2/library/keyword.html: \#keyword.kwlist\|keyword.kwlist\]\])
and any Python builtin (See:
\[https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html builtins\]) are
reserved words that cannot be used as attribute or datapoint names. If a
model attribute or datapoint has a name conflict with a reserved
identifier, the *here.attribute* or *dsname_dpname* syntax will resolve
the issue.

In addition, the expression has access to a few provided utility
functions:

-   `avg(dpList)`: Computes the average value of a list of items,
    excluding any None values.
-   `pct(numeratorList, denominatorList)`: Computes a percentage of sums
    of the numerator list and the denominator list. None values are
    assumed to be zero, and if the denominator is zero the returned
    value is zero.

### Datapoint Aggregator Datasource

A Datapoint Aggregator datasource is a datasource like any other: it
resides in a template, which will be bound to a device or component that
we will attempt to collect against. The aggregating datasource has two
important pieces of configuration: the target elements to get data from,
and the target datapoint on those elements.

The elements to collect from are controlled by the configured Target
Method name. This can be any method or relationship present on the
element type to which the template will be bound, and must require no
arguments. This method must return an iterable of all elements against
which we will collect. For example, for an aggregate datasource on a
device, we could collect from all of its components by setting this
field to *getMonitoredComponents* or from all of its interfaces by using
*os.interfaces*. By default, the method is *getElements*, which is
expected to be used on a custom ElementPool component. See:
[Implementing a Custom ElementPool Component](#implementing-a-custom-element-pool-component).

The datapoint to collect from each element is specified by the
Datasource, Datapoint, and RRA fields. As expected, this will collect
the value from dsname_dpname:RRA on each target element before
aggregating the set of values.

A datapoint on a Datapoint Aggregator type datasource provides the
configuration of the aggregation operation to perform on the set of
collected values. Multiple such datapoints can be configured on a single
datasource to perform several aggregations on the same set of data. The
'Operation' field must be one of the available operations provided by
the ZenPack. Some operations may take additional arguments, which should
be a string of comma-separated values in the 'Arguments' field.

#### Available Aggregation Operations

The following aggregation operations are available (aliases included).
Operations that result in different units than those submitted are
noted.

-   *count*: The number of elements collected. Not unit-consistent.
-   *sum*: The sum of all elements collected.
-   *max*: The maximum of all elements collected.
-   *min*: The minimum of all elements collected.
-   *amean* (*avg*): The [arithmetic mean or average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean){.external-link}
    of all elements collected.
-   *median*: The
    [median](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median){.external-link} of all
    elements collected.
-   *stddev* (*std*): The [standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation){.external-link}
    of all elements collected.
-   *var*: The
    [variance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance){.external-link} of
    all elements collected. Not unit-consistent.
-   *mad*: The [median absolute deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation){.external-link}
    of all elements collected.
-   *percentile*: Takes an additional argument *n* (0-100). Returns the
    [nth percentile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile){.external-link}
    value from the set of target datapoints.

#### Thresholding on Aggregate Datapoints: Additional Event Detail

When a MinMax threshold is violated on an aggregate datapoint, an
additional event detail is added to the generated event. The *violator*
detail of the event will contain a set of (uid, value) tuples for each
target element whose value is above the threshold. For example, if the
median operation is applied to \[3,3,5,9,11\] and has a maximum
threshold of 4, the elements corresponding to the 5, 9, and 11 values
would appear in the *violator* detail.

The value given in the *violator* tuple will correspond to the aggregate
operation requested: the *std* and *mad* operations will provide each
element's deviation as its corresponding value, and the *var* operation
will provide the square of each element's deviation. All other
aggregations will use the value of the target datapoint as collected.

#### Best Practices for Derived Datapoints: Using Topological Sort

@lb[](img/zenpack-aggregation_delay_diagram.png)

As mentioned above, both Calculated Performance and Datapoint Aggregator
datasources incur a 1-collection cycle delay when collecting. This
problem compounds when both are in play. Each time you calculate or
aggregate a datapoint, a 1-cycle delay is added. In this example, some
aggregations are performed, then a calculation, then a final
aggregation. Each step incurs a 1-cycle delay, resulting in data that is
4 cycles old by the time the final aggregation is stored.

@lb[](img/zenpack-aggregation_delay_mitigated.png)

However, not all compound datapoints necessarily incur a delay. If the
derived datapoints for the Final Aggregator, Calculated Point, Super
Aggregator, and both Aggregating Entities are set to the same cycle
time, and all of these datasources are within a single device's context
(i.e., the device itself or a component of that device), we will perform
a [topological sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting){.external-link}
on the datapoint dependency graph to attempt to collect them so that all
three values are available within one collection cycle. This sorting
requires that there be no cyclic dependencies between datapoints.

#### Implementing a Custom ElementPool Component

There are many scenarios for using an aggregate datapoint where it makes
no sense to put the aggregate datapoint on an existing device or
component. For example, an aggregate datapoint may want to calculate
across disparate devices and components. For this situation, we provide
a generic *ElementPool* component. The base *ElementPool* stores its
members as a list of UUIDs of device/components to target, and
implements the *getElements()* method that will return the appropriate
list.

To implement your own specific type of component with pool
functionality, inherit from *ElementPool* and implement the
*getMembers()* method as desired. Your component need not use the
internal member list, or may store other values in the list, as long as
the *getMembers()* method returns the correct items. Then, configure
your aggregate datapoints to target the *getMembers* function (this is
the default).

You must create these components at modeling time like any other
component. Then the configured datapoints will be collected.

    class RandomContentsElementPool(ElementPool):
        portal_type = meta_type = 'RandomContentsElementPool'

        def getElements(self):
            return [x for x in self.device().getMonitoredComponents() if random.random() > 0.314159]

## Caveats

All derived datapoints rely on reading previously collected target
datapoints from the performance data store. As such, the calculation of
the derived value will be delayed by as much as an entire collection
cycle. In general, derived datapoints should be considered to incur a
1-cycle delay for each aggregation or calculation step. In practice, we
can often compute an entire tree of aggregation and calculation steps in
the same collection cycle. See: Best Practices for Derived Datapoints:
Using Topological Sort.

Derived datapoints are only based on the most recent available data from
target datapoints. This is limited to data up to 5\*cycleTime seconds in
the past. If a target datapoint does not exist on the target element, or
has not been collected in the recent past, that element will be excluded
from the calculation. This may mean that fewer datapoints than desired
are used in the calculation (for aggregate datapoints), or that the
overall result cannot be calculated at all. An event will be sent when
this occurs.

!!! note "Zenoss 4 Note"
    Performance data is stored locally on the collector.
    So only data from devices and components on the same collector can be
    aggregated. This is not a limitation in Zenoss 5.

## Auto Adjustment of the Collection Intervals

By default, Zenoss tries to auto adjust the collection intervals for
both Calculated Performance and Datapoint Aggregator datasources to show
aligned data intervals on the utilization graphs. It determines basis
collection interval of the target datapoints and uses the interval for
the aggregated/calculated datasources. In case of multiple basis
datapoints with different collection intervals, the shortest interval
will be used.

If you want to disable this feature, you have uncheck the "Use Basis
Interval" flare for your aggregated/calculated datasources. The "Use
Basis Interval" property can be found on the aggregated/calculated
datasource's configuration menu. When the "Use Basis Interval" is
checked, the Minimum and Maximum Interval properties will be used to set
limits of the basis interval. For instance, when the basis interval
equals to 40 seconds and the Minimum Interval value is 60 seconds, the
Minimum Interval will be used as the collection interval, the same rule
is applicable to the Maximum Interval property. Minimum Interval cannot
be less than 1 second.

!!! note "Zenoss 4 Note"
    The auto adjustment of the collection intervals works
    only on Zenoss 5.
