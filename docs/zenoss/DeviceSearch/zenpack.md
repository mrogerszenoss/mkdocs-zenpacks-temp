## Global Device Search ZenPack

This ZenPack provides the ability to quickly search for Devices by their
name or by their IP address.

support for this ZenPack via our online forums. Enterprise support for

## Background

Compatible with Zenoss RM 4.2.x and 5.x

Search is triggered by typing 3 or more characters into the text box,
which then returns the first 10 matches. The use of the asterisk
wild-card is supported, so you may search for fuzzy matches dynamically.
