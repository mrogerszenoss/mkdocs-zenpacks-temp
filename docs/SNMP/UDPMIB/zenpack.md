## UDP Performance ZenPack

This ZenPack collects SNMP statistics on UDP from the standards-based
UDP-MIB.

## Support

This ZenPack is developed by the Zenoss user community and supported via
our online forums. Zenoss, Inc. does not provide direct support for this
ZenPack.

## Background

This ZenPack collects SNMP statistics on UDP from the standards-based
UDP-MIB. This MIB should be well-supported on nearly any SNMP-capable
device. This ZenPack provides a **UDP-MIB** device class under
**/Devices** that you may bind to pull UDP performance data. This
ZenPack can be used to provide alerting for systems that are under a
large UDP connection load. The author's idea is to use this to determine
when a system is under attack, compromised, or misconfigured and doing
something stupid.
