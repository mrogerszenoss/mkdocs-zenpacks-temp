## AdvaFSP150CC ZenPack

Monitor Adva FSP150 optical transport equipment.

It has only been tested against the FSP150CC GE-112 and FSP
150-GE114Pro. Other models may be detected but there are no performance
monitoring templates for them. The zenpack is written so that other
models will be detected and if a performance monitoring template with
the same name as the model is created then it will be applied to the
slot. The NetPort template assumes a Y.1731 test is running

every 5 minutes.
