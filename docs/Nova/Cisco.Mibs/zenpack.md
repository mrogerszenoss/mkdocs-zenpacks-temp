## Cisco MIBs ZenPack

This ZenPack consists of all the publicly available (and edited to be
loadable into Zenoss) MIBs for Cisco devices. The MIBs may be used for
translating SNMP traps.

## Support

This ZenPack is developed by the Zenoss user community and supported via
our online forums. Zenoss, Inc. does not provide direct support for this
ZenPack.

## Releases

Version 1.1- [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenpacks/ZenPacks.Nova.Cisco.Mibs/1.1/ZenPacks.Nova.Cisco.Mibs-1.1.egg){.external-link}:   Compatible with Zenoss Core 3.1.x, Zenoss Core 3.2.x, Zenoss Core
    4.2.x

## Background

Because of the amount of objects that this ZenPack creates within the
zodb it will take several hours to install this pack. Depending on
hardware roughly anywhere between 4 to 7 hours generally. This pack
saves a lot of tricky manual effort to get the Mibs loaded in as there
is a very specific way that it needs to be done by hand (because of mib
dependencies) which is time consuming to figure out and do properly.
