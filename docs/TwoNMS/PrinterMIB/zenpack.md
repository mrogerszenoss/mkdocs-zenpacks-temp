## Printer MIB ZenPack

This ZenPack monitors printers supporting the new RFC3805 PrinterMIB
(supersedes RFC1759). Version 2.0.0 creates separate components for
toners, supplies and input trays.

## Support

This ZenPack is developed by the Zenoss user community and supported via
our online forums. Zenoss, Inc. does not provide direct support for this
ZenPack.

## Releases

Version 1.1- [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenpacks/ZenPacks.TwoNMS.PrinterMIB/1.1/ZenPacks.TwoNMS.PrinterMIB-1.1.egg){.external-link}:   **Summary of changes:** Updated by curry to work for 3.2.x and 4.2.x:   Compatible with Zenoss Core 3.2.x, Zenoss Core 4.2.x

Version 2.0.0- [Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/zenpacks/ZenPacks.TwoNMS.PrinterMIB/2.0.0/ZenPacks.TwoNMS.PrinterMIB-2.0.0.egg){.external-link}:   **Summary of changes:** re-written to fully support v4.2.x and
    RFC3805:   Released on 2013/06/03:   Compatible with Zenoss Core 4.2.x

## Background

Updated the Zenpack to fully support RFC3805. More printer models have
been tested. Version 2.0.0 of this Zenpack has been tested on Zenoss
core v4.2.1.

In case you don't see the Printer components then try deleting the
printer + adding it directly to the /Printer/PrinterMIB tree.

Caveat: moving devices into the /Printer/PrinterMIB tree does not seem
to work on my installation
