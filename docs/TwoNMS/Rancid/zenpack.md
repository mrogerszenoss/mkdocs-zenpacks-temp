## Background

This ZenPack integrates RANCID from Shrubbery networks into Zenoss. A
separate daemon takes care of running rancid on a daily basis. Devices
can be added into the Rancid monitoring by changing the zProperties. All
configuration changes are made visible as new device components and the
content is available in the component details.

Integration with external SVN viewers like ViewVC is included.
