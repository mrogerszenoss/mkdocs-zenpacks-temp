## Event Forwarder ZenPack

This ZenPack adds new event notification actions that are used by the
zenactiond daemon for forwarding events.

## Support

This ZenPack is developed by the Zenoss user community and supported via
our online forums. Zenoss, Inc. does not provide direct support for this
ZenPack.

## Background

The Event Forwarder action forwards events to the eventForwarder rabbit
queue. Destination extension packs, such as
ZenPacks.SteelHouseLabs.SplunkForwarder and
ZenPacks.SteelHouseLabs.ZenossForwarder, can then consume this queue and
process events to their appropriate destination.

See github README for more info.
