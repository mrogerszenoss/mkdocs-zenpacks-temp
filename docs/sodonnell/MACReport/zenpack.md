## Background

This ZenPack consists of a report for listing each MAC address and the
Device and Interface it is associated with. This report makes use of the
layer 2 catalog already present in Zenoss. It only allows sorting by MAC
address and is not exportable. The author made this decision because the
processing time was too great for an installation with more than a few
thousand interfaces. The author can make another one available that is
exportable and sortable by the other two fields (device and interface),
if anyone decides they would like to live through the painful wait time.
