## Background

This ZenPack consists of a report that shows all of the Event classes
that have an event transform specified within your Zenoss installation.
The larger the number of event transforms, the harder it is to keep
track of them all, so this is found to be a valuable report. This report
is sortable by the event class name, EventClassKey, transform, and
number of events in that class. It is very similar to the All
EventMappings report.
