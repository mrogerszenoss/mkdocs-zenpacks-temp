Modeling will only pick up services that are running.</p> <p>INSTALLATION:</p> <p>During installation and removal the ZenPack rebuilds device relations for all devices within the /Server/Windows device class. Depending on the number of devices that you have in that class, it can take a long time. You will notice some errors in the UI while the relations are being rebuilt, which is normal. Please be patient and allow it to complete. After the relations have been rebuilt Zenoss should be restarted. Make sure that the zenwinsrvsnmp daemon is running after the restart is performed.</p> <p>ZPROPERTIES:</p> <ul> <li>zWinServiceSNMPIgnoreNames: Place the full names of any services     that you want to ignore in this line by line.</li> <li>zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNames: Place the full names of any services     which you explicitly want to monitor (ignoring all others) in this     line by line.</li> <li>zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNamesEnable: This enables/disables the use of     zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNames</li> </ul> <p>Note that you need to remodel your devices for the above to take effect.</p> <p>Keep in mind that zWinServiceSNMPIgnoreNames is constantly in use. If you put the same service name in both zWinServiceSNMPIgnoreNames and zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNames it will be ignored.</p> <p>DAEMON:</p> <ul> <li>zenwinsrvsnmp: Make sure this daemon is running or service     monitoring won't work.</li> </ul> <p>TEMPLATE:</p> <ul> <li>WinServiceSNMP in /Server/Windows: This template is required for     monitoring services. Do not bind this template to the device. Make     sure the template is in the class that the device is in (or a higher     class). The template will automatically be used for the windows     services components.</li> </ul> <p>MODELER PLUGIN:</p> <ul> <li>community.snmp.WinServiceMap: This plugin is required during     modeling.</li> </ul> <p>TIPS:</p> <p>Generally changes to monitoring status are immediately pushed to collector daemons, but sometimes if the daemon is too busy the daemon misses the change. In those cases the monitoring status doesn't get picked up by the daemon until the next reconfig cycle, which can take a while. If you notice that you're often still getting windows service down notifications shortly after you've toggled monitoring off on a windows service, you can add the following transform to the /Status/WinServiceSNMP event class to resolve this (this transform will only work on Zenoss 4.2.x and later).</p> <pre><code># drop events for unmonitored winservicesnmp components\nif component.monitor == False: evt._action = 'drop'\n</code></pre> <p>SCREENSHOTS:</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Nova/WinServiceSNMP/zenpack.html#attachments","title":"Attachments:","text":"<ul> <li>microsoft-zenpack.png</li> <li>ZP1.png</li> <li>ZP2.png</li> <li>ZP3.png</li> <li>microsoft-zenpack.png</li> <li>ZP1.png</li> <li>ZP2.png</li> <li>ZP3.png</li> <li>microsoft-zenpack.png</li> <li>ZP1.png</li> <li>ZP2.png</li> <li>ZP3.png</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Nova/Windows.SNMPPerfMonitor/zenpack.html","title":"Windows SNMP Performance Monitor (Advanced)","text":""},{"location":"Nova/Windows.SNMPPerfMonitor/zenpack.html#community","title":"Community","text":"<p>This ZenPack is developed and supported by the Zenoss User Community.

It con\u00adtains a com\u00admand data source \u201ccheck_nginx_ng\u201d which is a slightly mod\u00adi\u00adfied ver\u00adsion of Chris Kelly's check_nginx_ng which in turn was based on check_nginx by Mike Adolphs. So thanks to them for doing the major\u00adity of the work! If your inter\u00adested you can pick it up over on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"community/NginxStatus/zenpack.html#attachments","title":"Attachments:","text":"<ul> <li>nginx-zenpack.png</li> <li>nginx-zenpack.png</li> <li>nginx-zenpack.png</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/Nimble/zenpack.html","title":"Nimble","text":""},{"location":"community/Nimble/zenpack.html#community","title":"Community","text":"<p>This ZenPack is developed and supported by the Zenoss User Community.

A new nimble device type is created with a new component type to represent volumes.</p> <p>The ZenPack provides a modeler plugin to discover all volumes for a Nimble device.</p> <p>It also provides device classes of /Storage and /Storage/Nimble.</p> <p>A performance template is provided to gather and graph the scalar data listed above. The ZenPack binds this template to the /Storage/Nimble device class.</p> <p>A component performance template is provided to gather data for volume usage and graph that data. Note that component templates must not be manually bound - they bind automatically to the object type that exactly matches the name of the template.</p> <p>The two Nimble MIBs are included in the ZenPack.</p> <p>A new event is raised on volume performance thresholds. This event includes a transform to improve the summary field of the event.</p> <p>Because this ZenPack needs to perform functions on SNMP values in performance templates, the Zenoss Calculated Performance ZenPack is a prerequisite, which itself has a prerequisite of the Python Collector ZenPack. Objects</p> <p>A new device object class - NimbleDevice - with a relationship of nimbleVolume (note capitalisation) A new component object class for a NimbleDevice - NimbleVolume - with a relationship nimbleDevice Modeler Plugins</p> <p>A modeler plugin - NimbleVolumeMap - which gathers id, name, various sizes, online status and number of connections. The three sets of size data are in 2 MIB values - high 32 bits and low 32 bits. The modeler combines these values to present a single value in the NimbleVolume object. We believe that the raw SNMP data is in MB. The modeler divides this by 1024 to present values as GB.</p> <p>The NimbleVolumeMap plugin is assigned to the /Storage/Nimble device class by the ZenPack. Templates</p> <p>Device-level template - NimbleGlobalStats - is available for device classes from /Storage/Nimble. It is bound to this device class in the ZenPack. It gathers and graphs ioreads/writes, ioSeqReads/Writes and ioNonSeqReadHits.</p> <p>Component template NimbleVolume (note the name exactly matches the new object class), is available for device classes from /Storage/Nimble. It must not be manually bound. It gathers volUsageHigh and volUsageLow SNMP tables. To convert these values into a single datapoint, the Zenoss Calculated Performance ZenPack is used to create a new datapoint of volUsage. These values are all in MB.</p> <p>Two thresholds are supplied for \"30 percent used\" and \"90 percent used\". They access the object's value for VolSize (ie the maximum size of the volume) and then threshold the VolUsage datapoint at the respective percentages. The threshold value is multiplied by 1024 (as the VolSize object data delivered by the modeler is given in GB). They generate a /Perf/Nimble event if the threshold is breached.</p> <p>Graphs are delivered of volUsageLow and volUsage. Note that the volUsage datapoint in the VolUsage graph has been modified with an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) formula of 1024,*,1024,* . This does not affect the value stored in the rrd datafile but does ensure that graph actually shows bytes, rather than MB. The autoscaling of the rrdgraph utility then automatically applies appropriate M / G / T on the labels. zProperties</p> <p>This ZenPack introduces no new zProperties but it does set the zPythonClass property to ZenPacks.community.Nimble.NimbleDevice for the device class /Storage/Nimble. MIBs</p> <p>Two MIBs are supplied with this ZenPack:</p> <pre><code>       NIMBLE-TRAP-MIB\n       NIMBLE-MIB\n</code></pre> <p>Events</p> <p>The performance template has a threshold which generates an event of class /Perf/Nimble.

The daemon: a. determines which side (Zenoss or Pagerduty) was most recently updated. b. changes the status of the non-authoritative event/incident to match the authoritative one c. copies/formats Pagerduty incident logs for view within the Zenoss event console details.</p> <p>This ZenPack uses the web service APIs of both Zenoss and PagerDuty.</p> <p>CREATING PAGERDUTY INCIDENTS:</p> <p>Since Pagerduty uses a key to identify the \"Services\" that notifications should be assigned to, the idea is to create a default service key event attribute (via transform) that Zenoss will use when creating Pagerduty Incidents. The default service key can then be overwritten by other event transforms according to the administrator's needs.</p> <p>For example, the following event transform might be applied at the root of the event class hierarchy. This transform determines whether a given device is a Windows or Unix device, and assigns the appropriate service key accordingly:</p> <p>unixServiceKey = 'UNIXKEY' # Unix Team windowsServiceKey = 'WINDOWSKEY' # Windows Team defaultServiceKey = 'DEFAULTKEY' # Default Team try: devClass = device.deviceClass().getOrganizerName() # string representing device class organizer if 'Linux' in devClass: evt.pdServiceKey = unixServiceKey elif 'AIX' in devClass: evt.pdServiceKey = unixServiceKey elif 'WMI' in devClass: evt.pdServiceKey = windowsServiceKey elif 'Windows' in devClass: evt.pdServiceKey = windowsServiceKey else: evt.pdServiceKey = device.zPDServiceKey except: # set to default if nothing found evt.pdServiceKey = defaultServiceKey</p> <p>This initial transform can then be overridden later by other event transforms depending on the event class (or whatever the administrator designs). Once the event has a corresponsing service key assigned, it can be passed as a parameter to an \"Event Command\" (Zenoss 3.x) or \"Notification\" (Zenoss 4.x) such as:</p> <p>python zenpagerduty.py -a create -z ${dev/zPDZenossServer} -u ${dev/zPDZenossUser} -p ${dev/zPDZenossPass} -H ${dev/zPDDomain} -T ${dev/zPDToken} -U ${dev/zPDUser} -e ${evt/evid} -S ${evt/pdServiceKey}</p> <p>which creates the Pagerduty Incident with the provided arguments.</p> <p>SYNCHRONIZING SERVICE:</p> <p>This ZenPack provides a service daemon called \"zenpdsync\" which periodically (default 60 seconds) pulls the last N ('eventsBuffer' option default 20) events from both Zenoss and Pagerduty. It correlates these into pairs and determines which was last updated. If the status of one of the pair differs from the other, then the most recently updated one's status is copied to the other. Relevant Pagerduty incident log details are also copied to the Zenoss console.</p> <p>ZPROPERTIES PROVIDED:</p> <p>zPDZenossServer: hostname of zenoss server zPDZenossUser: zenoss user allowed to query events zPDZenossPass: password for zenoss user zPDDomain: YOURNAMEHERE.pagerduty.com zPDToken: Token key needed for API calls zPDUser: Pagerduty user used for automatic updates (this will show in the console, I use a fake user called \"Zenoss\") zPDServiceKey: optional per-device service key (would need to be assigned in transform if used, however)</p> <p>COMPONENTS:</p> <p>The ZenPack has the following objects:</p> <p>An example notification (Zenoss 4.x) An example event command (Zenoss 3.x)</p> <p>INSTALLATION:</p> <p>It is recommended to run the \"zenpdsync\" from only one hub or collector, since the process does not need to be run multiple times for a single Zenoss installation. This means disabling the \"zenpdsync\" daemon on all but one of the hub/collectors.</p> <p>Be sure also to set defaults for the zProperties, as well as creating an event transform under the root class similar to the sample above. The bare minimum event transform would be:</p> <p>try: evt.pdServiceKey = device.zPDServiceKey except: evt.pdServiceKey = 'YOURSERVICEKEY'</p> <p>A transform has not been provided, as the author has encountered complications in the past related to event classes (they get removed if the Zenpack is uninstalled).</p>"},{"location":"community/PagerDuty/zenpack.html#attachments","title":"Attachments:","text":"<ul> <li>pagerduty-zenpack.png</li> <li>pagerduty-zenpack.png</li> <li>pagerduty-zenpack.png</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/PanduitMonitoring/zenpack.html","title":"Panduit Environmental Monitoring","text":""},{"location":"community/PanduitMonitoring/zenpack.html#community","title":"Community","text":"<p>This ZenPack is developed and supported by the Zenoss User Community.

I will provide their patches and also document here what actually needs to change in case the patches don't work for you either. The manual patch also worked for me on Core 4.2.

I can say personally that there is a strong need for this capability, and extremely few open-source options providing it.</p> <p>Although it was comprehensive, that ZenPack was unsuitable for our environment (we have an extensive Siebel deployment). This ZenPack \"repackages\" the best parts of the other one while simplifying its deployment and configuration. It's construction/layout is perhaps also better taylored to the conventional Zenoss Administration conventions.</p> <p>Rather than specifying the specific Siebel component against which to collect data, this ZenPack models the remote server and creates components corresponding to all available subcomponents. These subcomponents are then modeled and managed as typical device \"components\" (such as a file system).</p> <p>Components:</p> <p>The ZenPack provides the following</p> <pre><code>   SiebelComponent Template provides:\n       Data Sources\n           SiebelStatus returns number corresponding to component status\n           SiebelTasks returns the number of total tasks, good tasks, and bad tasks\n           SiebelPerf returns performance statistics per component\n       Thresholds\n           various (Min/Max)\n   ZenModeler plugins:\n       siebelComponentMap\n   Event Class:\n       /App/Siebel\n   zensiebelperf collector daemon\n</code></pre> <p>Installation:</p> <p>This ZenPack relies on a local install of the \"srvrmgr\" binary that ships with Siebel Enterprise Server. That binary must reside on the Zenoss server, as all commands to the remote server are performed through it. It is assumed that a working installation exists, and that the srvrmgr binary is symlinked to /opt/zenoss/libexec (the zenpack install will attempt to do this). The srvrmgr binary may also require modified permissions to run (mine is 755).</p> <p>If /opt/zenoss/libexec/srvrmgr works as the \"zenoss\" user, then the configuration is likely correct.</p> <p>New Device zProperties are added (these correspond to the command-line arguments of srvmgr):</p> <pre><code>   zSiebelEnterprise\n   zSiebelGateway\n   zSiebelServer\n   zSiebelUser\n   zSiebelPassword\n</code></pre> <p>All are required for the modeler/data source to function.</p> <p>A \"Siebel\" Device class should be added at some level of the Devices heirarchy, with the following:</p> <pre><code>   zCollectorPlugins should contain siebelComponentMap in the list of modeler\n</code></pre> <p>plugins</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <pre><code>   Zenoss Versions Supported: 3.x, 4.x\n   External Dependencies: see above notes\n   ZenPack Dependencies:\n   Installation Notes: zopectl restart; zenhub restart; zensiebelperf\n</code></pre> <p>restart after installing this ZenPack.</p> <pre><code>   Configuration: see above notes\n</code></pre> <p>History:</p> <p>Change History:</p> <pre><code>   1.0 initial release\n   1.5\n       3 datasources added to collect state, task, and performance data\n       zensiebelperf daemon added to collect data and serialize data collection\n       support for useMonitoredAttribute added to javascript\n       support for manual deletion of components added to SiebelComponent\n   2.0 rebuilt to support Construction Kit and Zenoss 4.x\n   2.7 support for ConstructionKit 2.0\n</code></pre> <p>Tested: This ZenPack was tested with Zenoss versions 3.x and Zenoss 4.x</p> <p>Source: https://github.com/zenoss/ZenPacks.community.zenSiebelCRM</p> <p>Known issues: None</p>"},{"location":"community/zenSiebelCRM/zenpack.html#attachments","title":"Attachments:","text":"<ul> <li>siebel-zenpack.png</li> <li>siebel-zenpack.png</li> <li>siebel-zenpack.png</li> </ul>"},{"location":"community/zenSplunkSearch/zenpack.html","title":"Splunk Search Component","text":""},{"location":"community/zenSplunkSearch/zenpack.html#community","title":"Community","text":"<p>This ZenPack is developed and supported by the Zenoss User Community.

One is to manage Windows devices via the SNMP protocol; the second is to demonstrate examples of using the Python Collector ZenPack.</p> <p>The ZenPack is based on two earlier ZenPacks by Ryan Matte:</p> <pre><code>       ZenPacks.Nova.Windows.SNMPPerfMonitor is available at http://wiki.zenoss.org/ZenPack:Windows_SNMP_Performance_Monitor_%28Advanced%29\n       ZenPacks.Nova.WinServiceSNMP can be found on the Zenoss wiki at http://wiki.zenoss.org/ZenPack:Windows_SNMP_Service_Monitor.\n</code></pre> <p>ZenPacks.Nova.Windows.SNMPPerfMonitor monitors cpu, memory, paging and processes; ZenPacks.Nova.WinServiceSNMP has a modeler to gather Windows Services components and a template to then gather operational status data.</p> <p>This ZenPack combines the functionality into one ZenPack and changes the data collection method from using commands to using SNMP. This ZenPack can coexist with Ryan's ZenPacks. In general, names have had \"Python\" appended to them to make similar objects distinct from Ryan's.</p> <p>The ZenPack introduces a new device class of /Server/Windows/Snmp and then adds subclasses for different numbers of processors, whereas Ryan's ZenPack works directly with devices under /Server/Windows.</p> <p>To determine which group to place a server in perform an snmpwalk command for hrProcessorLoad as follows:</p> <p>snmpwalk -v1 -c &lt;snmp string&gt; &lt;host&gt; hrProcessorLoad</p> <p>The number of lines corresponds to the number of CPUs.</p> <p>Unlike Ryan's ZenPack, I have NOT provided exhaustive templates for each different number of processors. A sample is provided; please expand the templates to suit your own device requirements.</p> <p>During installation and removal the ZenPack rebuilds device relations for all devices within the /Server/WindowsSnmp device class. Depending on the number of devices that you have in that class, it can take a long time. You will notice some errors in the UI while the relations are being rebuilt, which is normal. Please be patient and allow it to complete. After the relations have been rebuilt Zenoss should be restarted.</p> <p>Make sure that you lock the services to prevent them from being removed during a remodel while a service is down. Modeling will only pick up services that are running. zProperties</p> <pre><code>       zWinServiceSNMPIgnoreNames: Place the full names of any services that you want to ignore in this line by line.\n       zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNames: Place the full names of any services which you explicitly want to monitor (ignoring all others) in this line by line.\n       zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNamesEnable: This enables/disables the use of zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNames\n</code></pre> <p>Note that you need to remodel your devices for the above to take effect.</p> <p>Keep in mind that zWinServiceSNMPIgnoreNames is constantly in use. If you put the same service name in both zWinServiceSNMPIgnoreNames and zWinServiceSNMPMonitorNames it will be ignored. Templates</p> <pre><code>       PyTestSnmpCpu monitors CPU utilisation for each processor and the average total. Uses Python to drive SNMP\n       PyTestSnmpMem monitors memory and paging using Python to drive SNMP\n       PyTestCmdMemCpu monitors cpu and memory / paging using Python to drive commands. This template is not bound by default.\n       PyTestSnmpServProc monitors number of processes and number of services.

Make sure the template is in the class that the device is in (or a higher class).

The simplest are simply attributres of the device, like 'manageIp'. The second are attributes of either the HW or OS object. Those should be specified as, for example, 'os.version' or 'hw.tag'. The third are special fields that are not directly accessible as attributes. This includes 'productionState', 'name', 'performanceMonitor', and 'devicePath'. The 'performanceMonitor' field allows you to set the collector for a device. Use the name of the collector, as you would see in the UI.</p> <p>There MUST be a mapping for the 'productionState' field, because every Zenoss device MUST have a valid production state. The value in whatever field is mapped to productionState is first translated using the mapping in the configuration item labeled \"Mapping of production states from CMDB to Zenoss\".</p> <p>The 'name' field is used for the Zenoss device id. Every device in Zenoss MUST have an id, so you SHOULD make sure to map a value to name. However, the system does have some logic that it uses to try to identify a value for name if one is not provided. Specifically, the system will use the value mapped to name, if there is one, and it is a non-empty string. If not, then it checks to see if a value has been mapped to title, and if so, and it is a non-empty empty string, then it will use that. If that fails as well, then it checks to see if a value has been provided for manageIp - if so, and it's a valid IP address, then it will use that value for the name. If all of those fail, then the system will log an error, create an event with the error, and not try to create the device.</p> <p>The 'devicePath' field allows you to put devices into a device class other than '/Discovered'. The value mapped to this field MUST be a valid device class path, beginning with the '/' character. An example would be '/Server/SSH/Linux'. Any values that are not valid device class paths will be ignored, and a log message will be generated. The 'devicePath' field is only used on device creation; devices will not be moved from one device class to another.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/CMDBIntegrationNG/zenpack.html#remove-ip-below-this-production-state","title":"Remove IP Below this Production State","text":"<p>When the CMDB integration is changing the production state of a device to a value below this threshold, it will remove the manageIp value. With the default threshold, this will only affect devices that are being decommissioned, as the value for that production state is -1. Note that the IP address is completely removed; it would not reappear if the production state is reset, unless the CMDB integration is getting that IP from the CMDB.</p> <p>To disable this functionality, you can set the threshold to a value lower than any production state you have defined. For the default set of production states, setting this value to -1 or lower will prevent the integration from removing the IP address.</p> <p>The reason for this functionality is to prevent collisions between decommissioned devices and new devices coming from the CMDB, when IP addresses are re-used. You can keep the decommissioned device in Zenoss to allow viewing historical data, while allowing the integration to create a new device using the same IP address.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/CMDBIntegrationNG/zenpack.html#polling-interval","title":"Polling Interval","text":"<p>The Polling Interval, or 'cycletime', determines how often (in seconds) the database is polled and checked for updates. This is configurable in the service's configuration file, zencmdbpoll.conf.</p> <p>In Zenoss v5, this is accessible by opening the zencmdbpoll Service in Control Center, editing the Configuration file, and restarting the Service.</p> <p>Starting with version 2.0.0, the cycletime for zencmdbpoll is not used to control the polling interval. Instead set the full and incremental polling intervals in the CMDB configuration screen. A full run queries everything from the CMDB that matches the filter, and an incremental run only queries the CMDB for objects that have changed since the last run. This obviously is much faster, since it only has to work with a subset of the records from the CMDB. Objects in the CMDB that were not associated with a device or component in Zenoss, and which have not changed, will not be queried in an incremental run. In particular, if you have added components to a device in the CMDB, but the CMDB does not register that as a change to the device, those components would not be linked to their counterparts in Zenoss. Note that changing the CMDB configuration in Zenoss will trigger the next run to be a full, rather than incremental, run, regardless of the poll cycle settings.</p> <p>Note that the full polling interval in a production system should generally be set to 0, which disables it. In a test system, where you might be making changes that would require a full run to see the results, it's OK to set this to a non-zero value to allow for easier and faster testing.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/CMDBIntegrationNG/zenpack.html#test-access-to-cmdb","title":"Test Access to CMDB","text":"<p>'Test Access' button can be used for checking the connection to the CMDB system.

Both of these types are collected within the zenpython daemon provided by PythonCollector, so no new daemons are required.</p> <p> </p> <p>Calculated Performance datapoints are functionally the same as in v1.x. By configuring a Python expression, you can combine any datapoints or model attributes from the target device or component. The capabilities of the Python expression have been expanded in v2.0.</p> <p> </p> <p>Datapoint Aggregator datapoints are a new capability in v2.0. They perform a point-in-time aggregation of any other datapoint on a set of target elements. The target elements in question can be any elements in the Zenoss system that have datapoints associated with them. This is not limited by type, Device Class, or containing device, though it is limited to elements collected on the same physical collector as the aggregating element. An aggregation can be any n-ary commutative mathematical operation, such as sum, maximum, or standard deviation.

The expression can reference any other datapoint or model attribute on the device or component. For example, the expression <code>(hw.totalMemory \u2013 memAvailReal) / hw.totalMemory</code> uses the totalMemory attribute modeled from the device and the datapoint memAvailReal to calculate a percentage used. Dotted-name model attributes can reference functions or relationships as long as they take no arguments.</p> <p>The expression can reference datapoints using any of the following syntaxes. Replace dsname with the name of your datasource and dpname with the name of your datapoint.</p> <ol> <li><code>dpname</code>: This option is the simplest if you know that your     datapoint name is unique for the device or component to which it's     bound, and the datapoint name is a valid Python variable name (i.e.     it contains no hyphens.)</li> <li><code>dsname_dpname</code>: This option should be used if there's a chance that     your datapoint name is not unique for the device or component. Using     the datasource name's then an underscore as a prefix guarantees     uniqueness. This option requires that both the datasource and     datapoint name be valid Python variables names. Support for this     syntax was added in version 1.0.7.</li> <li><code>datapoint['dpname']</code>: This option can be used if the datapoint's     name is not a valid Python variable name and the datapoint is unique     for the device or component to which it's bound. Support for this     syntax was added in version 2.0.3.</li> <li><code>datapoint['dsname_dpname']</code>: This is the most verbose, but safest     option. It can be used when the datapoint name is not unique, and     either the datasource or datapoint name is not a valid Python     variables name. Support for this syntax was added in version 2.0.3.</li> </ol> <p>If there are model attributes and datapoints that have a name conflict, the datapoint's value will be used. To disambiguate, you can use here.attribute to specify a model attribute, and the dsname_dpname name to specify a datapoint.</p> <p>In v2.0, the capabilities of the expression have been expanded. Any eval-able Python code can be used, including control structures and any built-in functions, as long as it returns a single numeric value. This means that any Python keyword (See: [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/keyword.html: #keyword.kwlist|keyword.kwlist]]) and any Python builtin (See: [https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html builtins]) are reserved words that cannot be used as attribute or datapoint names. If a model attribute or datapoint has a name conflict with a reserved identifier, the here.attribute or dsname_dpname syntax will resolve the issue.</p> <p>In addition, the expression has access to a few provided utility functions:</p> <ul> <li><code>avg(dpList)</code>: Computes the average value of a list of items,     excluding any None values.</li> <li><code>pct(numeratorList, denominatorList)</code>: Computes a percentage of sums     of the numerator list and the denominator list. None values are     assumed to be zero, and if the denominator is zero the returned     value is zero.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zenoss/CalculatedPerformance/zenpack.html#datapoint-aggregator-datasource","title":"Datapoint Aggregator Datasource","text":"<p>A Datapoint Aggregator datasource is a datasource like any other: it resides in a template, which will be bound to a device or component that we will attempt to collect against.

This can be any method or relationship present on the element type to which the template will be bound, and must require no arguments. This method must return an iterable of all elements against which we will collect. For example, for an aggregate datasource on a device, we could collect from all of its components by setting this field to getMonitoredComponents or from all of its interfaces by using os.interfaces. By default, the method is getElements, which is expected to be used on a custom ElementPool component. See: Implementing a Custom ElementPool Component.</p> <p>The datapoint to collect from each element is specified by the Datasource, Datapoint, and RRA fields.

This problem compounds when both are in play. Each time you calculate or aggregate a datapoint, a 1-cycle delay is added. In this example, some aggregations are performed, then a calculation, then a final aggregation. Each step incurs a 1-cycle delay, resulting in data that is 4 cycles old by the time the final aggregation is stored.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, not all compound datapoints necessarily incur a delay. If the derived datapoints for the Final Aggregator, Calculated Point, Super Aggregator, and both Aggregating Entities are set to the same cycle time, and all of these datasources are within a single device's context (i.e., the device itself or a component of that device), we will perform a topological sort on the datapoint dependency graph to attempt to collect them so that all three values are available within one collection cycle. This sorting requires that there be no cyclic dependencies between datapoints.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/CalculatedPerformance/zenpack.html#implementing-a-custom-elementpool-component","title":"Implementing a Custom ElementPool Component","text":"<p>There are many scenarios for using an aggregate datapoint where it makes no sense to put the aggregate datapoint on an existing device or component. For example, an aggregate datapoint may want to calculate across disparate devices and components. For this situation, we provide a generic ElementPool component.

In practice, we can often compute an entire tree of aggregation and calculation steps in the same collection cycle. See: Best Practices for Derived Datapoints: Using Topological Sort.</p> <p>Derived datapoints are only based on the most recent available data from target datapoints. This is limited to data up to 5*cycleTime seconds in the past. If a target datapoint does not exist on the target element, or has not been collected in the recent past, that element will be excluded from the calculation. This may mean that fewer datapoints than desired are used in the calculation (for aggregate datapoints), or that the overall result cannot be calculated at all. An event will be sent when this occurs.</p> <p>Zenoss 4 Note: Performance data is stored locally on the collector. So only data from devices and components on the same collector can be aggregated. This is not a limitation in Zenoss 5.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/CalculatedPerformance/zenpack.html#auto-adjustment-of-the-collection-intervals","title":"Auto Adjustment of the Collection Intervals","text":"<p>By default, Zenoss tries to auto adjust the collection intervals for both Calculated Performance and Datapoint Aggregator datasources to show aligned data intervals on the utilization graphs. It determines basis collection interval of the target datapoints and uses the interval for the aggregated/calculated datasources.

The \"Use Basis Interval\" property can be found on the aggregated/calculated datasource's configuration menu. When the \"Use Basis Interval\" is checked, the Minimum and Maximum Interval properties will be used to set limits of the basis interval. For instance, when the basis interval equals to 40 seconds and the Minimum Interval value is 60 seconds, the Minimum Interval will be used as the collection interval, the same rule is applicable to the Maximum Interval property.

Adding multiple controller nodes in the same cluster will result in Zenoss performing double or even triple monitoring of the same data.</p> <p>Zenoss will automatically discover both the in-band and out-of-band management addresses for each controller node in the cluster on an ongoing basis. If at any point Zenoss is unable to communicate with a controller node, it will round-robin through the other controller nodes until it finds one that's reachable.

See Configuration Properties for more information on this zProperty.</p> <p>In cases where a CIMC device contains lots of components and it takes more than zCollectorClientTimeout's value to model the device, the modeling session will be interrupted due to the timeout.

For example, the primary path of a private dashboard named \"Test\" is \"/zport/dmd/ZenUsers/&lt;USERID&gt;/dashboards/Test\". Promoting the dashboard to global changes the primary path to \"/zport/dmd/ZenUsers/dashboards/Test\".</p> <p>Note: Dashboard names must be unique in each relationship context.

These will be included in any services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned components.</p> <p> </p> <p>Internal Impact Relationships:</p> <ul> <li>Chassis temperature sensor and chassis power supply unit failure     impacts chassis management controller.</li> <li>Chassis management controller failure impacts all related chassis     slots, chassis power consumption, and the device.</li> <li>Chassis management controller failure impacts all the blade devices     available in its slots.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Server power supply sensor failure impacts server power supply.</li> <li>Processor failure impacts processor cache.</li> <li>Temperature, server power supply, cooling fan, chip set, and     processor failure impacts main system chassis.</li> <li>Controller battery failure impacts controller.</li> <li>Main system chassis failure impacts device, video controller,     software, port, nic port, memory card, digital sensor, power     consumption, analog sensor, controller.</li> <li>Controller and enclosure failure impacts physical disks.</li> <li>Physical disk failure impacts virtual disk.</li> </ul> <p>External Impact Relationships:</p> <ul> <li>In the scope of VxRail integration, a PowerEdge physical disk     failure impacts vSphere datastore.</li> </ul> <p>Most of the impacts described above follow the default policy of a node being in the worst state of the nodes that impact it. For example, a Chassis Management Controller failure will imply that all related blade devices are also failed.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Dell.PowerEdge/zenpack.html#usage","title":"Usage","text":""},{"location":"zenoss/Dell.PowerEdge/zenpack.html#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>External

This is so that IP configuration changes to nodes can be updated even in cases where a node no longer has an external IP.</p> <p>Please note that IP address changes that take place will be updated when the Cluster device is remodeled (not the Node device).</p> <p>For performance data collection, queries are conducted on a randomly selected external IP address belonging to either the cluster or one of the nodes. If a SmartHost IP is used as the host when initially adding the Cluster, then the SmartHost IP will be included in this selection.</p> <p>Monitoring of the Isilon cluster and its nodes is designed with the expectation that each node will have at least one external IP interface that is accessible for monitoring.</p> <p>Although version 1.0.1 removes this requirement (nodes can now be modeled/monitored without an external interface), it should still be considered a strong recommendation since monitoring multiple nodes against a single IP address could impact monitoring performance and/or reliability.</p> <p>Operating with a small pool of IPs against a larger number of nodes means that API queries (used by this ZenPack) for each node, in addition to the cluster itself, will be directed at a subset of the nodes for the cluster. The <code>zEMCIsilonHttpPoolSize</code> zProperty has been introduced (version 1.0.1) and may ameliorate this concern by limiting the number of simultaneous API queries.</p> <p>The EMC Isilon documentation seems to support this perspective in that it recommends a scaling formula for determining the number of IP Addresses that should be made available depending on the size of a cluster:</p> <ul> <li>Isilon External Network Connectivity Guide</li> <li>Isilon Advanced Networking Fundamentals     (pdf)</li> </ul> <p>For example, the \"Isilon External Network Connectivity Guide\" recommends a total of 19 IP addresses (divided into pools) for a 3-node cluster.</p> <p>One additional thing to note is that the optional SNMP monitoring will not work without at least one external IP address assigned to each node.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/EMC.Isilon/zenpack.html#onefs-api-minimally-privileged-user","title":"OneFS API Minimally Privileged User","text":"<p>Certainly the default \"admin\"

(according to the \"isi statistics client\" command output) instead of just one.</p> <p>Fortunately, the creation of a Role with the needed Privileges is straightforward and can be done from the

Discovery and monitoring are performed using SNMP, iLO (XML/HTTP), and/or WBEM protocols depending on environment.</p> <p>This ZenPack currently supports HP Proliant servers running Windows or Linux (with installed/configured HP SIM SNMP subagent), HP Enclosures (via SNMP) as well as iLO devices (via either iLO or SNMP) and VMWare ESXi (using HP custom ESXi with WBEM/CIM access configured).</p> <p>It is important to note that not all features of this ZenPack are supported across all protocols, since each of them provides a part, but not all, of the total information used by the ZenPack. This limitation is based on the amount and quality information that is available from each of the supported protocol. What this means is that certain metrics for a given component type (such as a temperature sensor) may or may not be available depending on the type of device that is monitored and/or on the protocol used to collect that data.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/HP.Proliant/zenpack.html#external-dependencies","title":"External Dependencies","text":"<p>This ZenPack relies on several protocols to achieve coverage of various aspects of the HP Proliant architecture. At the most basic level, SNMP should be configured so as to facilitate access to HP/Compaq MIBs (CPQSINFO-MIB, CPQRACK-MIB, etc) and the associated OIDs. Support on a bare metal install of Linux or Windows OS, for example, requires installation of HP SIM and its associated software components, including a SNMP subagent and associated configuration for its use with the OS SNMP agent. Configuration of these software components is covered by various documentation available from HP and is beyond the scope of this document.</p> <p>SNMP is also supported natively by HP OnboardAdministrator (if available) and optionally by the iLO management interface.</p> <p>As noted above, iLO management interface can be monitored (as a Zenoss device) via iLO protocol (essentially XML via HTTP) or SNMP (which can be enabled in the iLO GUI interface).</p> <p>An additional important item to note is that the iLO management interface GUI requires that the associated server's FQDN and IP address be set manually. This ZenPack requires the configuration of FQDN(or hostname)/IP be set in order for Zenoss to create associations on its side between monitored Proliant servers and their associated iLO device in Zenoss.</p> <p>Support for HP Proliant hardware running VMWare ESXi OS relies on a custom ESXi image available from HP. This custom image provides support for Proliant-specific monitoring and performance data that is not avaiable using the version of ESXi provided by VMWare. Additionally, WBEM support must be configured and enabled on the ESXi host.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/HP.Proliant/zenpack.html#features","title":"Features","text":"The features added by this ZenPack can be summarized as follows.

The collected performance information includes: pool sizes for data sources (JDBC), Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs), message queues (JMS), threads, servlets, JSPs, and classloaders. Cache information is also accessible, providing system administrators insight into the number of hits (or misses) their cache policy has produced.</p> <p>This ZenPack also aggregates individual performance metrics into higher level concepts that provide a picture of the performance of the application. Cache hits and misses are combined on the same graph to provide an overall picture of cache performance. Likewise, queue metrics are combined to show the number of messages currently on the queue, being processed, and being placed on the queue. Queue subscribers and publishers are also graphed.</p> <p>Each of the individual performance metrics can be trended and predicted, and thresholds can be explicitly defined. Both the predicted thresholds and explicit thresholds inform system administrators of potential future problems before they occur. Since so much of J2EE involves \"managed resources\", the ability to monitor pool sizes and alert administrators prior to resources being exhausted is extremely valuable and can reduce the likelihood of a fatal outage caused by resource depletion.</p> <p>Most of the metrics represent combinations of individual component metrics. For example, the Thread Pool metric represents all threads in all pools. It is possible to configure this ZenPack to perform at higher granularity and have it monitor a Thread Pool with a particular name. However, since these names are application specific we have chosen to configure this ZenPack to collect at a rather coarse-grained level by default. The installer is highly encouraged to customize and configure!</p> <p>One particular monitoring template that requires end-user configuration involves Servlets. If a site to be monitored is revenue generating, and credit card submissions from the website are handled via a back-end servlet, it may be critically important to monitor the resources made available by the JBoss container to the servlet container. If the number of free spaces in the servlet pool dwindles to zero it could prevent your application from making a sale.</p> <p>The following are the collected metrics for JBoss servers:</p> <ul> <li>Active Threads</li> <li>JMS Message cache memory usage</li> <li>JMS Message hits/misses</li> <li>JMS Topic/Destination queue size</li> <li>Java heap memory usage</li> <li>JCA commit, rollback, and transaction count</li> <li>JCA Connection pool in-use connections and available connections</li> <li>JCA connections created/destroyed</li> <li>JCA total connections</li> <li>JGroups cluster messages sent/received</li> <li>JGroups cluster bytes sent/received</li> <li>MBean creation/removal count</li> <li>MBean messages processed count</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zenoss/JBossMonitor/zenpack.html#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"Prerequisite Restriction Product Zenoss platform 4.x, Zenoss 2.2 or higher Required ZenPacks ZenPacks.zenoss.ZenJMX, <p>ZenPacks.zenoss.JBossMonitor</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/JBossMonitor/zenpack.html#configuring-jboss-to-allow-jmx-queries","title":"Configuring JBoss to Allow JMX Queries","text":"<p>JBoss uses the JAVA_OPTS approach for enabling remote access to MBeans. However, it requires some additional properties. To set up your JAVA_OPTS for use in JBoss see the following code segment:</p> <pre><code>JAVA_OPTS=\"-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=12345\"\nJAVA_OPTS=\"${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false\"\nJAVA_OPTS=\"${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false\"\nJAVA_OPTS=\"${JAVA_OPTS} -Djboss.platform.mbeanserver\"\nJAVA_OPTS=\"${JAVA_OPTS} -Djavax.management.builder.initial=org.jboss.system\\\n.server.jmx.MBeanServerBuilderImpl\"\nexport JAVA_OPTS\n</code></pre> <p>When you start JBoss via the run.sh you must also pass the \"-b 0.0.0.0\" argument:</p> <pre><code>cd ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin\n./run.sh -b 0.0.0.0\n</code></pre> <p>JMX actually uses two separate ports for MBean access: one is used for initial connection handling and authentication, and the other is used for RMI access. During the handshake between a JMX Client and the JMX Agent the agent tells the client the IP address and port number for the RMI registry. By default JBoss sets the IP address to 127.0.0.1. This works when the JMX client and the JMX agent reside on the same device, but it won't work in a distributed environment.</p> <p>By passing the \"-b 0.0.0.0\" argument you instruct JBoss to bind to all available network ports, and this results in the JMX Agent's handshaking logic using a network reachable address when informing clients of the RMI registry hostname and port.</p> <p>The <code>jmx-console</code> Web page in JBoss allows you to view the different MBeans that are available; however, this does not mean that these MBeans are available remotely.

This mode of suppression requires that the zenoss.snmp.ClientMACs modeler plugin be enabled and successfully functioning on all network devices such as switches and routers that you believe could be a root cause of other monitored devices becoming unreachable.</p> <p>There are two ways symptomatic ping events can be suppressed. By manually configuring the ultimate gateway(s) of the device(s) using the zL2Gateways property, or by leaving the zL2Gateways property empty and setting the zL2PotentialRootCause property appropriately so that the gateway(s) can be automatically discovered.</p> <p> </p> <p>The diagram above depicts a common data center network topology where each rack has a redundant pair of access switches sometimes referred to as top-of-rack switches. Each of those top-of-rack switches connect to a redundant pair of end-of-row switches. Each of those end-of-row switches connect to a redundant pair of core switches for the data center. Then perhaps the pair of core switches connect to a pair of gateway routers to connect the data center to the Internet or other data centers over private links. In this kind of topology the layer 3 gateway for hosts is often the core switches.</p> <p>In this type of topology the gateways for host-1-1-1 can be automatically discovered to be rack-1-1a and rack-1-1b if zL2PotentialRootCause is enabled for the switches, and disabled for the hosts. zL2PotentialRootCause should be enabled for devices that could potentially be a root cause for other devices becoming unreachable, and disabled for devices that cannot be a root cause. This property is important to prevent root caused events from incorrectly being suppressed.</p> <p>By relying on this automatic discovery of gateways we can only achieve suppression of events from the hosts. We'd get all of the host events suppressed in the case of an entire data center outage, but all of the rack, row, core, and gateway events would remain unsuppressed and it would be left as manual identification of the gateways as the root cause.</p> <p>To achieve multi-hop suppression the zL2Gateways property must be configured. Despite the name of the property containing \"L2\", the configured gateways need not be restricted to the layer 2 gateways. In the example topology above, the best value for zL2Gateways would likely be gw-a and gw-b (one per line). It's important to use the Zenoss device id(s) for the gateways, and to enter one per line in zL2Gateways. There's no limit to the number of gateways, but more than two probably isn't realistic.</p> <p>With zL2Gateways set to gw-a and gw-b in the above topology, a complete failure of the data center would result in all events being suppressed except for two events: a ping failure on each of gw-a and gw-b. This is assuming that zL2SuppressIfDeviceDown is enabled. See ''Non-Ping Event Suppression' below for more information on zL2SuppressIfDeviceDown.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Layer2/zenpack.html#non-ping-event-suppression","title":"Non-Ping Event Suppression","text":"<p>Suppression of non-ping events can be enabled on a per-device or device class basis by enabling the zL2SuppressIfDeviceDown configuration property. No other configuration or modeling is necessary. Events will only be suppressed for a device with this property enabled when they have a new, acknowledged, or suppressed critical event in the /Status/Ping event class. This suppression is effective at reducing the potential clutter of symptomatic events when a device is no longer reachable on the network either because it has failed, or because the Zenoss collector is no longer able to reach it.</p> <p>This suppression can be used together with ping event suppression for the most complete reduction of symptomatic event clutter.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Layer2/zenpack.html#event-suppression-performance","title":"Event Suppression Performance","text":"<p>All forms of event suppression as described above have a cost in terms of event processing performance. When zL2SuppressIfDeviceDown is enabled, there is a small additional overhead for processing all events. When zL2SuppressIfPathsDown is enabled and first-hop suppression is performed using either automatic gateway discovery or manual gateway configuration, there is another small overhead for processing ping failure events.</p> <p>In worst case scenario testing the effective processing rate for non-ping events with the zL2SuppressIfDeviceDown configuration is approximately 80%, 75% for processing ping failure events in the case of a first-hop switch failure, and 70% in the case of a third-hop gateway failure.</p> <p>All suppression is performed by an event plugin executed within zeneventd processes. Given that zeneventd can be scaled by adding more workers/instances, this additional event processing overhead can be offset by running more zeneventd instances as event processing throughput needs require.</p> <p>In order to achieve acceptable event processing performance, a variety of caches are used within zeneventd processes. These caches can lead to events not being suppressed in some cases when the configuration, model, or status of devices is coming from stale cache information. The following types of caches are used with different timeouts.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Layer2/zenpack.html#caches","title":"Caches","text":"<ul> <li>Device status changes can take up to 50 seconds to affect     suppression.</li> <li>Configuration changes can take up to 10 minutes to affect     suppression.</li> <li>Modeling changes can take up to 55 minutes to affect suppression.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"zenoss/Layer2/zenpack.html#network-map","title":"Network Map","text":"<p>The network map can be used to see connections between devices.

To support this, the ZenPack updates a dedicated database of connectivity information at two different times. When modeling a device results in a change, and periodically in the background to catch any changes not caught during modeling updates.</p> <p>Updating the connectivity database does have some performance cost, and it isn't always necessary to have the information updated during modeling if the most up-to-date information isn't required, or in the background if you expect the modeling-time updates to catch all relevant changes. Towards this end there are two configuration properties that allow you to selectively disable modeling-time updates (zL2UpdateOnModel), background updates (zL2UpdateInBackground), or both. By default both of these properties are enabled.</p> <p>Bear in mind that setting both properties to false will prevent all of this ZenPack's functionality from working for the device(s) in question. If you find that modeling is slowed down to unacceptable levels, then you might consider setting zL2UpdateOnModel to false and allowing the background processing to reconcile chanages periodically. However, if you find that the zenmapper service is consuming too many resources you may want to consider setting zL2UpdateInBackground to false and allowing the modeling-time updates to do all of the work. Using the default of having both properties set to true results in the best experience on systems not suffering from performance problems because the connectivity information is as up-to-date as possible, and will be periodically reconciled in case of external changes.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Layer2/zenpack.html#service-impact","title":"Service Impact","text":"<p>When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds built-in service impact capability based on Layer 2 data.

Instead of broadcasting incoming link layer frames to all it's interfaces, as hubs do, switches look into the forwarding table to find out which particular interface is connected to the destination device. The switch learns which devices are connected to which interface by looking at the source MAC address of incoming frames. Those MAC addresses are called \"client MAC addresses\".</p> <p>For zenoss to discover Layer 2 connection between some devices, MAC address of some interface of one device should be equal to client MAC address of some interface of other device. You could check if client MAC addresses for interface are modeled by looking at it's \"Clients MAC addresses\" display. It there are none, check that <code>zenoss.snmp.ClientMACs</code> modeler plugin is bound to device, and remodel device.</p> <p>It is also possible that there are no MAC address required to discover connection in forwarding table. To check that, you could run debug utility bridge_snmp.py:</p> <pre><code>python bridge_snmp.py clientmacs -c &lt;community_string&gt; &lt;host&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>and see if your client mac address is visible at switch at all.</p> <p>Records in forwarding table are aged pretty fast, by default in 5 minutes. So, when there were no network activity on connection for more than 5 minutes, entry will be removed from switch forwarding table. You could check <code>dot1dTpAgingTime</code> object to know exact timeout period in seconds:</p> <pre><code>$ snmpget -v2c -c &lt;community_string&gt; &lt;host&gt; 1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.2.0\nSNMPv2-SMI::mib-2.17.4.2.0 = INTEGER: 300\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"zenoss/Layer2/zenpack.html#impact","title":"Impact","text":"<p>This ZenPack also adds impact relation for layer2 connections.

Detailed information about latency and its time estimation can be found in the Log data ingestion time in Azure Monitor.

Note that Azure Monitor latency is variable, it depends on the configuration of your Azure device (e.g. number of components, consumed resources, etc.). Therefore after some changes on your device (adding, removal of some components, etc.), the <code>monitor_latency</code>  value is recommended to recalculate to avoid possible issues during the event monitoring.

See the Kerberos Tickets\n    section for more information.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinTrustedRealm:   Enter the name of the domain which is trusted by the user's\n    domain. This can be a child or other domain which has a trust\n    relationship with the user's domain. For example, if zWinRMUser\n    is *username@example.com*, and austin.example.com is a child of\n    the example.com domain, enter *austin.example.com* into\n    zWinTrustedRealm.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinTrustedKDC:   This property must be set if zWinTrustedRealm is set. It must be\n    the IP address or resolvable name of a valid Windows domain\n    controller for the trusted realm. You may also enter a comma\n    separated list of kdc addresses.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMServerName:   This property should only be used in conjunction with domain\n    authentication when the DNS PTR record for a monitored server's\n    managed IP address does not resolve to the name by which the\n    server is known in Active Directory. For example, if myserver1\n    is known as myserver1.ad.example.com by Active Directory and is\n    being managed by IP address 192.51.100.21, but 192.51.100.21\n    resolves to myserver1.example.com, you will have to set\n    zWinRMServerName to *myserver1.ad.example.com* for domain\n    authentication to work.\n:   If many Windows servers in your environment don't have DNS PTR\n    records that match Active Directory, it is recommended that you\n    set the name of the Zenoss device's to be the fully-qualified\n    Active Directory name and set zWinRMServerName to\n    *${here/titleOrId}* at the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device\n    class. This avoids the necessity of setting zWinRMServerName on\n    every device.\n:   If the server name cannot be resolved and you are using domain\n    authentication, it is recommended that you set the Id of the\n    device to the IP address and the Title to the server name it is\n    known by in Active Directory. Then use *${here/title}* for\n    zWinRMServerName. This situation can occur when no DNS server is\n    available. Kerberos always performs a reverse lookup when\n    obtaining a ticket to use a service on a computer. If your\n    servers are known by multiple names, the reverse lookup may\n    return the wrong name and you will see \"Server not found in\n    kerberos database\" errors. See the troubleshooting section on\n    this topic for a solution.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinScheme:   This must be set to either *http* or *https*. The default is\n    *http*.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinUseWsmanSPN:   If the HTTP/HTTPS service principals are exclusively in use for\n    a particular service account, such as on an IIS server, set this\n    option to true to use the WSMAN service principal name. You can\n    use this option for all domain joined Windows Servers that are\n    using a domain monitoring account.\n:   A domain controller may need &amp;ldquo;Validated write to service\n    principal name&amp;rdquo; permission for the NETWORK SERVICE account in\n    order for the WSMAN service principal name to be used.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMKrb5includedir:   Optional directory which contains one or more kerberos\n    configuration files. This is useful when extra kerberos options\n    are needed, such as disabling reverse dns lookup. See [MIT krb5.conf](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html){.external-link}\n    for a description of *includedir* and krb5.conf options\n    available. The directory must exist and contain only kerberos\n    configuration files. If the directory contains non-kerberos\n    configuration files, it will be ignored.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMDisableRDNS:   Kerberos always performs a reverse lookup when obtaining a\n    ticket to use the HTTP/HTTPS/WSMAN service principal. If there\n    are multiple names by which servers are known in your\n    organization, or if you do not want to use reverse lookups, set\n    this value to True. Because this is a kerberos property, it can\n    only be set one way or another. You cannot mix and match this\n    value and only the top level value at /Server/Microsoft will be\n    honored.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMKRBErrorThreshold:   Having a poor network connection can cause erroneous kerberos\n    error events to be sent which could cause confusion or false\n    alarms. The default value is 1, which will always send an event\n    on the first occurrence of an error. You can increase this value\n    to send an event only when there have been x amount of\n    occurrences of an error during collection, where x denotes the\n    threshold number.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinKeyTabFilePath:   This property is currently used and reserved for future use when\n    keytab files are supported.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMPort:   The port on which the Windows server is listening for *WinRM* or\n    *WS-Management* connections. The default is *5985*. It is\n    uncommon for this to be configured as anything else.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinPerfmonInterval:   The default interval in seconds at which *Windows Perfmon*\n    datapoints will be collected. The default is *300* seconds or 5\n    minutes. It is also possible to override the collection interval\n    for individual counters.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMEnvelopeSize:   This property is used when the winrm configuration setting for\n    MaxEnvelopeSizekb exceeds the default of 512k. Some WMI queries\n    return large amounts of data and this envelope size may need to\n    be enlarged. A possible symptom of this is seeing an xml parsing\n    error during collection or \"Check WMI namespace and DCOM\n    permission\" returned from the OperatingSystem modeler plugin.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRSCodePage:   The code page which is in use on the Windows Server for the\n    monitoring user account. The default is to use 65001, the\n    identifier for unicode. The full list is\n    [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317756(v=vs.85){.external-link}.aspx){.external-link}.\n    To determine the code page in use on a Windows server, run\n    `chcp` at a command prompt.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"zenoss/Microsoft.Core/zenpack.html#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>Please refer to the Zenoss Service Dynamics documentation if you run into any of the following problems:</p> <ul> <li>ZenPack will not install</li> <li>Adding a device fails</li> <li>Don't understand how to add a device</li> <li>Don't understand how to model a device</li> </ul> <p>If you cannot find the answer in the documentation, then Resource Manager (Service Dynamics) users should contact Zenoss Customer Support.

Let's walk through an example of using Wireshark to resolve an authGSSClientStep failed error.</p> <p>First install Wireshark on your system. It's GUI is easier to use than the command line equivalent.</p> <p>Next you will need to create a packet capture file on your Zenoss server. Assuming the Windows server you're trying to monitor is 192.0.2.101 and the domain controller (zWinKDC) is 203.0.113.10, you would run the following command as the root user on your Zenoss server.</p> <pre><code>tcpdump -s0 -iany -w kerberdebug.pcap host 192.0.2.101 or host 203.0.113.10\n</code></pre> <p>This will start capturing all packets to or from those two IP addresses. It will continue to capture these packets until you type CTRL-C.</p> <p>Now you should attempt to remodel the Windows server where you're encountering the error. Once it completes, and fails, again you should go back to the terminal where tcpdump is running and type CTRL-C. You will now have a kerberdebug.pcap file in the directory where you ran the command.</p> <p>Copy kerberdebug.pcap to your system where you installed Wireshark. Start Wireshark and open kerberdebug.pcap. You should see something like the following.</p> <p> </p> <p>You'll see that there's a KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW error. Searching for this specific error code will quickly show that it occurs when the kerberos client and server don't have their time's synchronized. There's a tolerance for some difference, but in this case it was a big difference due to misconfiguration.</p> <p>There are some kerberos errors you'll see in the packets that a completely normal part of negotiation and won't lead to any problems. You should ignore the following errors shown in Wireshark:</p> <ul> <li>KRB5KRB_API_ERR_TKT_EXPIRED: Zenoss will subsequently request a     new ticket when this occurs.</li> <li>KRB5KRB_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED: This is a normal part of kerberos     negotiation.</li> <li>KRB5KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG: Most requests won't fit in UDP.     Zenoss will automatically switch to TCP.</li> </ul> <p>You'll also see other kerberos messages that are normal. You should ignore these kerberos messages shown by Wireshark:</p> <ul> <li>TGS-REQ</li> <li>AS-REQ</li> </ul> <p>The following are the most common errors: - KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW: - As shown in the above example. A clock synchronization issue. - KRB5KDC_ERR_S_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN - This can happen if zWinRMServerName resolves to the server's IP address, but is not the name the server is known by in Active Directory. This will also be the error if you don't enter a zWinRMServerName and the reverse resolution of the device's manage IP address resolves to a name that doesn't match the server's name in Active Directory. Typical solutions to this are to add the name to the /etc/hosts file or to directly use the IP address of the server.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Microsoft.Core/zenpack.html#troubleshooting-zendotnet","title":"Troubleshooting zendotnet","text":"<p>The zendotnet service implements a REST api on ports 5001(http)/5050(https) of the collector.

In HyperV 2.0.0 or greater, all devices will use zendotnet by default. To use txwinrm, update zMicrosoftTxRx to txwinrm. Please refer to Microsoft Core documentation for more details. You can enable the WinRM service on the Hyper-V server's hosting machine by running Command Prompt as Administrator and executing the following commands.</p> <p>This command configures the WinRM service, creates WinRM listener and enables firewall exception for WS-Management traffic. After executing the command below, make sure to type y and hit enter to approve the changes. (This step is required and must be run by an Administrator)</p> <pre><code>winrm quickconfig\n</code></pre> <p>This setting allows for the maximum concurrent operation and shells per user. (If you do not want to use the maximum settings, please see note below for more information)</p> <pre><code>winrm s winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxShellsPerUser=\"2147483647\"}' winrm s winrm/config/service '@{MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser=\"4294967295\"}'\n</code></pre> <p>Set this setting if you plan on using Basic Authentication (WinRM default is Kerberos, please see note below for more information)</p> <pre><code>winrm s winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic=\"true\"}\n</code></pre> <p>Set this setting if you plan on using HTTP with basic authentication. (WinRM default is HTTPS, please see note below for more information)</p> <pre><code>winrm s winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted=\"true\"}\n</code></pre> <p>The above instructions use the max values for MaxConcurrentOperationsPerUser and WinRS MaxShellsPerUser. If you do not want to set these to the max, then a value of 50 should be adequate. The default is 5 on both, which will cause problems because Zenoss will open up concurrent requests for each WQL query and set of Perfmon counters.</p> <p>If you choose to use Basic authentication it is highly recommended that you also configure HTTPS. If you do not use the HTTPS protocol your user name and password will be sent over in clear text. If you have challenges setting up HTTPS on the Windows clients and you don't mind sending the payload in clear text but require the user name and password to be encrypted then using the Kerberos authentication is the best option. HTTPS is not required for Kerberos but is recommended.</p> <p>If you choose to take the WinRM default configurations you must supply Kerberos authentication settings in the zProperties. The Kerberos authentication process requires a ticket granting server. In the Microsoft Active Directory environment the AD Server is also the KDC. The zWinKDC value must be set to the IP address of the AD Server and the collector must be able to sent TCP/IP packets to this server. Once this is set your zWinRMUser must be a FQDN such as jsmith@Zenoss.com and the zWinRMPassword must be set correctly for this user account.</p> <p>The HTTPS setup must be completed on each client. At this time we do not have notes on automating this task but are currently in the process of testing several options. To successfully encrypt your payload between the Zenoss server and the Windows client you must install a Server Authentication certificate on tbe client machine. The process for requesting and installing the appropriate certificate can be found at the following URL. http://blogs.technet.com/b/meamcs/archive/2012/02/25/how-to-force-winrm-to-listen-interfaces-over-https.aspx Once the client has the correct certificate installed you only need to change the zWinScheme to HTTPS and zWinRMPort to 5986. If you are still having challenges setting up HTTPS on the client you can execute the following command on any AD server to verify the appropriate SPN record exists for Kerberos authentication.</p> <pre><code>setspn -l hostname1\n</code></pre> <p>If you do not see a record with HTTPS/ at the beginning of the hostname you will need to create the record. For example:</p> <pre><code>setspn -s HTTPS/hostname1.zenoss.com hostname1\n</code></pre> <p>Install the Integration Services on virtual machines</p> <p>If you want your guest devices to be discovered, the Integration Services should be installed on your virtual machines. By default, most Windows virtual machine has Integration Services already installed by default.</p> <p>Follow the directions below, if your Windows virtual machine does not have Integration Services installed.</p> <ul> <li>From the Action menu of Virtual Machine Connection, click Insert     Integration Services Setup Disk.</li> <li>If Autorun does not start the installation automatically, you can     start it manually navigating to the CD drive.

It is more efficient and will put less of a burden on the device's resources. The Windows Security log can and most likely will contain many audit events. See the LogAlways below.</p> <p>For example, a custom view that searches for events in the last hour, with the severity of Warning or Critical, and Ids of 104, 110-115, 155 will result in the following XPath query:  </p> <pre><code>&lt;QueryList&gt; &lt;Query Id=\"0\" Path=\"Application\"&gt; &lt;Select Path=\"Application\"&gt;*[System[(Level=1 or Level=3) and (EventID=104 or (EventID &gt;= 110 and EventID &lt;= 115) or EventID=155) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &lt;= 3600000]]]&lt;/Select&gt; &lt;/Query&gt; &lt;/QueryList&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Simply copy this and paste it into the eventlog datasource Event Query field and save.

Subsequent queries will only look at events that have occurred since the last time this datasource was run. We write a timestamp to the registry location HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\zenoss\\logs\\ to know when the last time the datasource was executed. If you are testing a datasource and would like to reset this time, then simply remove the string value with your datasource name in the registry hive, \\SOFTWARE\\zenoss\\logs\\, for your use under HKEY_USERS.</p> <p>Note: The script to search for events and return relevant data is approximately 3700 characters.

The following configuration properties can be used to support monitoring other environments.</p> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMUser:   The syntax used for zWinRMUser controls whether Zenoss will\n    attempt Windows local authentication or domain (kerberos)\n    authentication. If the value of zWinRMUser is *username*, local\n    Windows authentication will be used. If zWinRMUser is\n    *username@example.com*, domain authentication will be used. The\n    zWinKDC and potentially the zWinRMServerName properties become\n    important.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMPassword:   Password for user defined by *zWinRMUser*.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinKDC:   The zWinKDC property must be set if domain authentication is\n    used. It must be the IP address or resolvable name of a valid\n    Windows domain controller. To use multiple KDCs, you can enter a\n    comma-separated list of valid addresses or supply different KDCs\n    across different Device Classes. See the Kerberos Tickets\n    section for more information.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinTrustedRealm:   Enter the name of the domain which is trusted by the user's\n    domain. This can be a child or other domain which has a trusting\n    relationship with the user's domain. For example, if zWinRMUser\n    is *username@example.com*, and austin.example.com is a child of\n    the example domain, enter *austin.example.com* into\n    zWinTrustedRealm.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinTrustedKDC:   This property must be set if zWinTrustedRealm is set. It must be\n    the IP address or resolvable name of a valid Windows domain\n    controller for the trusted realm.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMServerName:   This property should only be used in conjunction with domain\n    authentication when the DNS PTR record for a monitored server's\n    managed IP address does not resolve to the name by which the\n    server is known in Active Directory. For example, if myserver1\n    is known as myserver1.ad.example.com by Active Directory and is\n    being managed by IP address 192.51.100.21, but 192.51.100.21\n    resolves to www.example.com, you will have to set\n    zWinRMServerName to *myserver1.ad.example.com* for domain\n    authentication to work.\n:   If many Windows servers in your environment don't have DNS PTR\n    records that match Active Directory, it is recommended that you\n    set the name of the Zenoss devices to be the fully-qualified\n    Active Directory name and set zWinRMServerName to\n    *${here/titleOrId}* at the /Server/Microsoft/Windows device\n    class. This avoids the necessity of setting zWinRMServerName on\n    every device.\n:   If the server name cannot be resolved and you are using domain\n    authentication, it is recommended that you set the Id of the\n    device to the IP address and the Title to the server name it is\n    known by in Active Directory. Then use *${here/title}* for\n    zWinRMServerName. This situation can occur when no DNS server is\n    available. Kerberos always performs a reverse lookup when\n    obtaining a ticket to use a service on a computer. If your\n    servers are known by multiple names, the reverse lookup may\n    return the wrong name and you will see \"Server not found in\n    kerberos database\" errors. See the troubleshooting section on\n    this topic for a solution.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinScheme:   This must be set to either *http* or *https*. The default is\n    *HTTP*.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinUseWsmanSPN:   If the HTTP/HTTPS service principals are exclusively in use for\n    a particular service account, such as on an IIS server, set this\n    option to true to use the WSMAN service principal name. You can\n    use this option for all domain-joined Windows Servers that are\n    using a domain monitoring account.\n:   A domain controller may need &amp;ldquo;Validated write to service\n    principal name&amp;rdquo; permission for the NETWORK SERVICE account in\n    order for the WSMAN service principal name to be used.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMPort:   The port on which the Windows server is listening for *WinRM* or\n    *WS-Management* connections. The default is *5985*. It is\n    uncommon for this to be configured as anything else.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinPerfmonInterval:   The default interval in seconds at which *Windows Perfmon*\n    datapoints will be collected. The default is *300* seconds or 5\n    minutes. It is also possible to override the collection interval\n    for individual counters.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinKeyTabFilePath:   This property is currently used and reserved for future use when\n    keytab files are supported.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zDBInstances:   This setting is only relevant when the *zenoss.winrm.WinMSSQL*\n    modeler plugin is enabled. Multiple instances can be specified\n    to monitor multiple SQL Server instances per server using\n    different credentials. The default instance is *MSSQLSERVER*.\n    Fill in the user and password to use SQL authentication. Leave\n    the user and password blank to use Windows authentication. The\n    default *MSSQLSERVER* credentials will be used for all instances\n    not specified. Microsoft recommends using Windows authentication\n    to connect to SQL Server.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMEnvelopeSize:   This property is used when the winrm configuration setting for\n    MaxEnvelopeSizekb exceeds the default of 512k. Some WMI queries\n    return large amounts of data and this envelope size may need to\n    be enlarged. A possible symptom of this is seeing an xml parsing\n    error during collection, OperatingSystem modeler plugin timeout,\n    or \"Check WMI namespace and DCOM permission\" returned from it.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMLocale:   The locale to use for communicating with a Windows server. The\n    default is *en-US*. This property is reserved for future use.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRSCodePage:   The code page is in use on the Windows Server for the monitoring\n    user account. The default is to use 65001, the identifier for\n    Unicode. The full list is here:\n    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317756(v=vs.85).aspx.\n    To determine the code page in use on a Windows server, run\n    `chcp` at a command prompt.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMKrb5includedir:   Optional directory which contains one or more kerberos\n    configuration files. This is useful when extra kerberos options\n    are needed, such as disabling reverse DNS lookup. See\n    http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html\n    for a description of *includedir* and krb5.conf options\n    available. The directory must exist and contain only kerberos\n    configuration files. If the directory contains non-kerberos\n    configuration files, it will be ignored.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMDisableRDNS:   Kerberos always performs a reverse lookup when obtaining a\n    ticket to use the HTTP/HTTPS/WSMAN service principal. If there\n    are multiple names by which servers are known in your\n    organization, or if you do not want to use reverse lookups, set\n    this value to True. Because this is a kerberos property, it can\n    only be set one way or another. You cannot mix and match this\n    value and only the top-level value at /Server/Microsoft will be\n    honored.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMClusterNodeClass:   Path under which to create cluster nodes. If you need to add\n    cluster nodes to a specific class under the\n    /Server/Microsoft/Windows device class, specify it with this\n    property. The default is /Server/Microsoft/Windows\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMKRBErrorThreshold:   Having a poor network connection can cause erroneous kerberos\n    error events to be sent which could cause confusion or false\n    alarms. The default value is 1, which will always send an event\n    on the first occurrence of an error. You can increase this value\n    to send an event only when there have been x amount of\n    occurrences of an error during collection, where x denotes the\n    threshold number.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWindowsRemodelEventClassKeys:   Use in conjunction with schedule_remodel in\n    ZenPacks.zenoss.Microsoft.Windows.actions to initiate a remodel\n    of a Windows or Cluster Device. See the ClusterOwnerChange\n    mapping in the /Status event class for example usage.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMConnectTimeout:   Used to define the time out for establishing a winrm connection.\n    If you are seeing failing tasks stay in a RUNNING state, you can\n    decrease this number so that the initial attempt to connect to a\n    device times out sooner.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinServicesModeled:   List of regular expressions for services to model. If\n    zWinServicesNotModeled is set, we will skip services from it\n    first.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinServicesNotModeled:   List of regular expressions for services to ignore during the\n    modeling process.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zSQLAlwaysOnEnabled:   Set to true to enable modeling and monitoring of MS SQL\n    Always-On components.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zSQLAlwaysOnReplicaPerfdataNode:   Availability Replicas performance data location windows node.\n    Possible values: \"local\", \"separate\". Default: \"separate\"\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMLongRunningCommandOperationTimeout:   Operation timeout for Powershell long-running command. Default\n    value is slightly greater than zWinPerfmonInterval to allow each\n    step of long-running command to finish.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinRMConnectionCloseTime:   Time when WinRM connections exist before it being closed. Needed\n    for existing GSS client to decrypt leftover encrypted requests.\n    Used only for domain (Kerberos) authentication.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinDBStateMonitoringIgnore:   MS SQL Database monitoring ignored statuses. Add database\n    statuses in which monitoring requests will not be performed for\n    MS SQL Databases.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinDBSnapshotIgnore:   MS SQL Database Snapshots modeling disabled. Set to true to\n    disable modeling and monitoring of MS SQL Database snapshots.\n</code></pre> <p>-</p> <pre><code>zWinServicesGroupedByClass:   List of regular expressions for Windows services to model with\n    generic Windows Service class. Specify class names to set\n    generic Windows Service class names for matching Windows\n    Services.\n:    this property-appropriate use case is when a target Windows\n    device has a lot of Windows Services with rotating name\n    extension - \"service_name_0123456789bcdef\". In this case, each\n    Windows service creates a separate Windows Service class. So we\n    can group these services by Windows Service generic class. This\n    grouping will create only one Windows Service CLass for each\n    service group. Note: The regex is not anchored to the start of\n    the service name. So we have to specify the correct generic\n    Windows Class in zProperty values for services whose Windows\n    Class name should be truncated to specific zProperty value.\n    Example: In order to model all \"CDPUserSvc\\_\\*\" Windows Services\n    under one generic Windows Service class \"CDPUserSvc\" we should\n    specify \"CDPUserSvc\" in zProperty values.\n</code></pre> <p>Note: HyperV and MicrosoftWindows ZenPacks share a krb5.conf file as well as tools for sending/receiving data. Therefore if either HyperV or Windows device has a correct zWinKDC setting, it will be used for another device as well.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Microsoft.Windows/zenpack.html#configuring-mssql-server-modelingmonitoring","title":"Configuring MSSQL Server Modeling/Monitoring","text":"Supported versions of SQL Server: SQL Server 2008 * SQL Server 2008 R2 * SQL Server 2012:   SQL Server 2014:   SQL Server 2016:   SQL Server 2017:   SQL Server 2019 <p>Notes:</p> <ul> <li>In order to properly monitor SQL Server, the Client Tools SDK must     be installed for each version of SQL Server installed on your     Windows servers.</li> <li>Microsoft will be ending extended     support     for SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 on 7/9/2019.

If you do not want to set this value to the max, then a value of 50 should be adequate. The default is 5, which will cause problems because Zenoss will open up concurrent requests for a set of Perfmon counters and any other shell-based datasource.</p> <p>Note: Starting from Windows ZenPack v.3.0.0 some monitoring operations were split into separate collection tasks. Hence, the number of WinRM shells may be increased. It may need to increase the MaxShellsPerUser to meet the new requirements. This is especially applicable for large environments.</p> <p>Note: If you choose to use Basic authentication it is highly recommended that you also configure HTTPS. If you do not use the HTTPS protocol your user name and password will be sent over in the clear text. If you have challenges setting up HTTPS on the Windows clients but require the user name and password to be encrypted, then using the Kerberos authentication is the best option. HTTPS is not required for Kerberos but is recommended. If you choose to use Kerberos authentication, then your payload will be encrypted.</p> <p>Note: If you are using kerberos on EL6 and higher to connect to your Windows Server, your data will be encrypted over HTTP. For kerberos on EL5, encryption is not supported so you must set the winrm AllowUnencrypted option to true.</p> <p>Note: If you choose to take the WinRM default configurations you must supply Kerberos authentication settings in the zProperties. The Kerberos authentication process requires a ticket-granting server. In the Microsoft Active Directory environment, the AD Server is also the KDC. The zWinKDC value must be set to the IP address of the AD Server and the collector must be able to send TCP/IP packets to this server. Once this is set your zWinRMUserName must be an FQDN such as someone@example.com and the zWinRMPassword must be set correctly for this user account. The domain name MUST be the name of the domain, not an alias for the domain.</p> <p>Note: In order to use a single domain user in a child domain or other trusted domain, set zWinKDC to the AD server of the user's domain. Then enter the trusted domain name and an associated domain controller in the zWinTrustedRealm and zWinTrustedKDC properties, respectively.</p> <p>Note: The HTTPS setup must be completed on each client. At this time we do not have notes on automating this task but are currently in the process of testing several options. To successfully encrypt your payload between the Zenoss server and the Windows client you must install a Server Authentication certificate on the client machine. The process for requesting and installing the appropriate certificate can be found in the following technet article Once the client has the correct certificate installed you only need to change the zWinScheme to HTTPS and zWinRMPort to 5986. If you are still having challenges setting up HTTPS on the client you can execute the following command on any AD server to verify the appropriate SPN record exists for Kerberos authentication.</p> <pre><code>c:\\&gt;setspn -l hostname1\n</code></pre> <p>If you do not see a record with HTTPS/ at the beginning of the hostname you can create the record, but this is not typically necessary as Windows will use the HOST/ record as the default for most built-in services. You can also use the zWinUseWsmanSPN property so that Zenoss will use the WSMAN service principal. The WSMAN spn is created by running winrm quickconfig.</p> <pre><code>c:\\&gt;setspn -s HTTPS/hostname1.zenoss.com hostname1\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"zenoss/Microsoft.Windows/zenpack.html#transitioning-from-windowsmonitor","title":"Transitioning from WindowsMonitor","text":"<p>If you are installing this ZenPack on an existing Zenoss system or upgrading from an earlier Zenoss version you may have a ZenPack named ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor already installed on your system.

To use a custom configuration file, place it in the $ZENHOME/var/krb5/config/ directory. In Zenoss 5.x, this location is in a container so you will need to be certain to commit any changes made. Upgrading Zenoss will lose these changes, so you will need to update your container after the upgrade. The file name can be anything that contains alphanumeric, dashes, and underscores. To add a permanent location for your configuration file, you can make use of the zWinRMKrb5includedir property. This must be a location accessible from within a container and contain ONLY kerberos configuration file(s). If the location is invalid or contains files other than kerberos configuration files, it will be ignored and not added to the main krb5.conf file.Example: A common problem with Kerberos is that a reverse DNS lookup will result in multiple records returned, and not always the correct one. Kerberos by default always performs a forward and reverse lookup when establishing a ticket. To disable the reverse lookup, create a file in either the default location or in a user-specified location and add the following:</p> <pre><code>[libdefaults] rdns = false\n</code></pre> <p>See krb5.conf for more information on the includedir and other kerberos options. You can also supply multiple KDCs for a domain with the Windows ZenPack. This can be done using either a comma-separated list in the zWinKDC property or supplying single KDCs for multiple devices or device classes under the /Server/Microsoft device class. This list also supports a simple regex to add, remove, and specify an admin_server. Adding a KDC - Use just the address or append a \"+\" to the beginning of the address to add a new kdc. Removing a KDC - Append a \"-\" to the beginning of the KDC address to remove an existing KDC from the krb5.conf file. This can be used if a KDC is no longer in service or if the wrong address was entered previously. This can be removed from zWinKDC once a ticket-granting ticket for the user has been obtained and the krb5.conf file is correct. Specifying an admin_server - Optionally, use an asterisk, \"*\", to denote the admin_server. If none is provided, the first kdc in the list will be used. The admin_server is used for any admin work, such as changing a password through kinit.For example, set zWinKDC to \"*10.10.10.10,10.10.10.20,+10.10.10.30,-10.10.10.40\" for specifying a comma-separated list. 10.10.10.10 will be a kdc and admin_server, 10.10.10.20 and 10.10.10.30 will be added as kdcs, and 10.10.10.40 is no longer a valid kdc address and will be removed. Note: Removing one or more errant KDCs from the system can be a time-consuming process, so we recommend double-checking that the addresses are valid when entering them into the zWinKDC property.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/Microsoft.Windows/zenpack.html#viewing-kerberos-tickets","title":"Viewing Kerberos Tickets","text":"<p>The ZenPack uses individual credential cache files in order to support multiple users across multiple domains.

Let's walk through an example of using Wireshark to resolve an authGSSClientStep failed error. First, install Wireshark on your system. Its GUI is easier to use than the command line equivalent. Next, you will need to create a packet capture file on your Zenoss collector. Assuming the Windows server you're trying to monitor is 192.0.2.101 and the domain controller (zWinKDC) is 203.0.113.10, you would run the following command as the root user on your Zenoss collector that is being used to model and monitor the Windows device.</p> <pre><code>tcpdump -s0 -iany -w kerberdebug.pcap host 192.0.2.101 or host 203.0.113.10\n</code></pre> <p>This will start capturing all packets to or from those two IP addresses. It will continue to capture these packets until you type CTRL-C. Now you should attempt to remodel the Windows server where you're encountering the error. Once it completes, and fails, again you should go back to the terminal where tcpdump is running and type CTRL-C. You will now have a kerberdebug.pcap file in the directory where you ran the command.Copy kerberdebug.pcap to your system where you installed Wireshark. Start Wireshark and open kerberdebug.pcap. You should see something like the following.</p> <p> </p> <p>You'll see that there's a KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW error. Searching for this specific error code will quickly show that it occurs when the kerberos client and server don't have their time's synchronized. There's a tolerance for some difference, but in this case, it was a big difference due to misconfiguration. There are some kerberos errors you'll see in the packets that are a completely normal part of negotiation and won't lead to any problems. You should ignore the following errors shown in Wireshark:</p> <ul> <li>KRB5KRB_API_ERR_TKT_EXPIRED: Zenoss will subsequently request a     new ticket when this occurs.</li> <li>KRB5KRB_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED: This is a normal part of kerberos     negotiation.</li> <li>KRB5KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG: Most requests won't fit in UDP.     Zenoss will automatically switch to TCP.</li> </ul> <p>You'll also see other kerberos messages that are normal. You should ignore these kerberos messages shown by Wireshark:</p> <ul> <li>TGS-REQ</li> <li>AS-REQ</li> </ul> <p>The following are the most common errors: - KRB5KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW: - As shown in the above example. A clock synchronization issue. - KRB5KDC_ERR_S_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN - This can happen if zWinRMServerName resolves to the server's IP address, but is not the name the server is known by in Active Directory. This will also be the error if you don't enter a zWinRMServerName and the reverse resolution of the device's manage IP address resolves to a name that doesn't match the server's name in Active Directory.

If you see OperationTimeout errors in the zenpython log, this is normal. The reason for this is that we run the Get-Counter PowerShell cmdlet over the course of two polling cycles and pull 2 samples by default. There is a 60-second timeout when attempting to receive data. If the received request does not finish within 60 seconds, you will see an OperationTimeout. You can decrease zWinPerfmonInterval to a lower value, which will pull samples more frequently. Other timeout issues on a domain could involve having a large Kerberos token. This could be caused by the user belonging to a large number of groups. See kb 970875 for more information on the cause and resolution. Possible side effects of a large token include high CPU usage on the Windows server.

(The error \u2018service is missing an address assignment\u2019 will be     displayed if you try to start the service)</p> </li> <li> <p>The IP assignment may be performed via the Control Center UI or     command-line.</p> </li> <li> <p>To use the UI:</p> </li> <li> <p>Log into the Control Center UI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click the Zenoss.resmgr name to display the     Applications/Zenoss.resmgr page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scroll down the page to the IP Assignments section and click     \u2018Assign\u2019 next</p> </li> <li> <p>to each line for the proxy-openstack and RabbitMQ-Ceilometer     services:</p> </li> <li> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>To use the command-line:</p> </li> <li> <p>~~~ sourceCode     serviced service assign-ip RabbitMQ-Ceilometer serviced service assign-ip proxy-zenopenstack     ~~~</p> </li> <li> <p>If you have multiple collectors, specify the collector name for each     service and repeat for each collector:</p> </li> <li> <p>~~~ sourceCode     serviced service assign-ip collector1/RabbitMQ-Ceilometer serviced service assign-ip collector1/proxy-zenopenstack serviced service assign-ip collector2/RabbitMQ-Ceilometer serviced service assign-ip collector2/proxy-zenopenstack     ~~~</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the zenpack is installed, provide SSH credentials to the Linux     devices in your OpenStack environment before adding any devices. *     Configure the zCommandUsername/zCommandPassword/zKeyPath properties     on the /Devices/Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost device class. * If your     OpenStack nodes are already managed under Zenoss, move them into     /Devices/Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost</p> </li> <li> <p>Device Setup</p> </li> <li> <p>Device Setup via UI</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the OpenStack ZenPack is installed and you can begin monitoring     by going to the infrastructure screen and clicking the normal button     for adding devices. You\u2019ll find a new option labeled, \u201cAdd OpenStack     Endpoint (Infrastructure).\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>Choose that option and you\u2019ll be presented with a dialog asking for     the following inputs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Device To Create - non-empty, non-ip, non-dns, unique name to use     for this device in Zenoss. \u2018\u2019See note below\u2019\u2019.</p> </li> <li> <p>Auth URL - A keystone URL. For Keystone\u2019s v3 API, it should look     like <code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:5000/v3/</code>.     For Keystone\u2019s v2 API, it should look like     <code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:5000/v2.0/</code>. To have the ZenPack choose the     newest supported API version, leave the path off, like     <code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:5000/</code> (sets zOpenStackAuthUrl).</p> </li> <li> <p>Username: Enter your OS_USERNAME (sets zCommandUsername).</p> </li> <li> <p>Password: Enter your OS_PASSWORD (sets zCommandPassword).</p> </li> <li> <p>User Domain Name: Enter the user domain name per OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME     (sets zOpenStackUserDomainName).</p> </li> <li> <p>Project Domain Name: Enter the project domain name per     OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME (sets zOpenStackDomainName).</p> </li> <li> <p>Region Name - choose the correct region from the drop-down. You may     only choose one, so each region you wish to manage must be     registered as a separate endpoint in Zenoss (sets     zOpenStackRegionName).</p> </li> <li> <p>Once you click Add, Zenoss will contact the OpenStack API and     discover servers, images and flavors. Once it is complete you\u2019ll     find a new device in the OpenStack device class with the same name     as the hostname or IP you entered into the dialog. Click into this     new device to see everything that was discovered.</p> </li> <li> <p>NOTE: The \u2018Device name\u2019 should be a non-empty, non-hostname, non-IP,     since that name will be used when the host is registered as a Linux     device. The name should be unique within the Zenoss environment.     This is especially important if you are adding another device that     share the same IP address or hostname that already exist on another     device. Not doing this may result in devices with the same name     conflicting with each other. (e.g. attempting to model device would     show modeling results that belong to another device OR device would     show relations that do not belong to that device)</p> </li> <li> <p>Device Setup via Zenbatchload</p> </li> <li> <p>You can setup the device using zenbatchload as follows:</p> </li> <li> <p>~~~ sourceCode     zenbatchload      ~~~ <li> <p>where <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> should have the form:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>/Devices/OpenStack/Infrastructure loader='openstackinfrastructure',\\ loader_arg_keys=['deviceName', 'username', 'api_key', 'project_id, 'user_domain_name', 'project_domain_name', 'auth_url', 'region_name', 'collector'] &lt;devicename&gt; username='&lt;username&gt;', api_key='&lt;password&gt;', project_id='&lt;tenant ID&gt;', user_domain_name='default', \\ project_domain_name='default', auth_url='http://&lt;ip address&gt;:5000/v2.0/', region_name='RegionOne' /Devices/Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost zCommandUsername='myusername', zCommandPassword='mypassword'</code></p> </li> <li> <p>As mentioned before, zCommandUsername and zCommandPassword     properties must be set for /Devices/Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost     devices (and vNICs) to be correctly modeled.</p> </li> <li> <p>Host Identification</p> </li> <li> <p>The OpenStack APIs do not contain an authoritative list of hosts     with unique IDs. Instead, various APIs show hosts by name or IP.     There zenpack does its best to identify IPs and names that refer to     the same host, and represent them as a single host component. In     some cases, though, it can\u2019t tell, and the same host may be modeled     twice, or with an incorrect name.</p> </li> <li> <p>Two zProperties are provided to override the default behavior of the     zenpack when this happens.</p> </li> <li> <p>zOpenStackHostMapSame</p> <p>Specifies that two names refer to the same host. It is a list of entries of the form: <code>&lt;name1&gt;=&lt;name2&gt;</code> For example,</p> <pre><code>my.example.com=myothername.example.com my.example.com=10.1.1.1\n</code></pre> <p>This means that any time the host \u201cmy.example.com\u201d, \u201cmyothername.example.com\u201d, or \u201c10.1.1.1\u201d is encountered, they will be considered to be the same host, rather than separate ones.</p> </li> <li> <p>zOpenStackHostMapToId</p> <p>It is also possible to specify not only that the devices are the same, but that they should be identified with one specific identifier (otherwise, one may be chosen at random). In this case, a list of entries of the form <code>&lt;name&gt;=&lt;id&gt;</code> may be provided in the zOpenStackHostMapToId zProperty. For example, <code>myothername.example.com=my.example.com 10.1.1.1=my.example.com</code> This would cause \u201cmy.example.com\u201d, \u201cmyothername.example.com\u201d, or \u201c10.1.1.1\u201d to all be definitely identified as \u201cmy.example.com\u201d, without the ambiguity that could exist if zOpenStackHostMapSame were used.</p> </li> <li> <p>zOpenStackHostLocalDomain</p> <p>In some environments (in particular, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform), hosts are assigned names that end in \u2018.localdomain\u2019. This would cause problems for Zenoss, because it is not possible to create a device in Zenoss with such a name, as they all resolve to 127.0.0.1, rather than their actual IP.</p> <p>The default value of zOpenStackHostLocalDomain is a blank string, meaning that the \u2018.localdomain\u2019 suffix will be stripped from host names, and devices will be created in Zenoss with those shortened names. If those names do not resolve in DNS, they will be created without IPs, and will not be modeled. You would need to manually set their management IPs so that they can be modeled.</p> <p>Alternatively, if you already have these hostnames in dns, but just with a different domain name than \u201c.localdomain\u201d, you may specify this domain name here, and it will be substituted for localdomain, and the devices will model automatically, based on the IPs returned from DNS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modeling Containerized Environments</p> </li> <li> <p>If the target OpenStack environment runs processes inside of docker     containers, it is necessary to configure several zProperties before     modeling will succeed.</p> </li> <li> <p>zOpenStackRunNovaManageInContainer: Container to run \u201cnova-manage\u201d     in</p> </li> <li> <p>zOpenStackRunVirshQemuInContainer: Container to run \u201cvirsh\u201d in</p> </li> <li> <p>zOpenStackRunNeutronCommonInContainer: Container to access neutron     configuration files in.</p> </li> <li> <p>These should be set to container names or substrings of the     container names. These can be set on the /Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost     device class or specific devices within it, as necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>NOTE: These zProperties must be set on the Linux devices, not the     OpenStack (/OpenStack/Infrastructure) devices.</p> </li> <li> <p>OpenStack Configuration</p> </li> <li> <p>Before event and performance data can be collected, the following     steps must be performed. That these steps are only tested with     currently-supported versions of OpenStack (Pike and higher).</p> </li> <li> <p>OpenStack Ceilometer Configuration</p> </li> <li> <p>Ceilometer is a component of openstack which, through a combination     of polling and notifications from the openstack message bus, collect     a variety of metric and event data from the openstack environment     and forwards it to external services, including Zenoss, for     processing.</p> </li> <li> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Ceilometer\u2019s polling agent and other openstack services (nova-api,     for instance) send notifications through an internal notification     bus, which are received by the ceilometer notification agent. It     then passes these notifications through configurable \u201cpipelines\u201d,     which ultimately deliver the data through publishers.</p> </li> <li> <p>In 2.4.x of this ZenPack, a custom ceilometer plugin called     \u2018ceilometer_zenoss\u2019 was used to send the data to zenoss through the     RabbitMQ-Ceilometer service.</p> </li> <li> <p>This approach was no longer practical with current versions of     OpenStack, so the collection mechanism was changed to use     ceilometer\u2019s built-in http publisher, rather than AMQP. Since the     http publisher is part of ceilometer, there is no need to install     additional software on the OpenStack environment to use this     mechanism. It is only necessary to configure it correctly, as     described below.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ceilometer must be configured to send data to the correct Zenoss     collector, using a device-specific URL.</p> </li> <li> <p>The OpenStack environment will therefore need https access to the     zenoss collector, and the Zenoss collector IP must be configured as     described in the Post-ZenPack-Installation Notes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the device is added, and its collector\u2019s proxy-zenopenstack     service has an assigned IP, the following two URLs will be displayed     at the bottom of the device\u2019s overview page:</p> </li> <li> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>These URLs will be required to configure ceilometer on the OpenStack     environment to send data to Zenoss. There are two ways to configure     ceilometer:</p> </li> <li> <p>RHOSP Configuration using TripleO (RedHat OpenStack Platform     Director)</p> </li> <li> <p>This is the best way to configure the Redhat OpenStack Platform.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the following to your environment template:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ManagePipeline: true PipelinePublishers: - *Zenoss Samples Publisher URL* - &lt;other_pipeline_publishers&gt; ManageEventPipeline: true EventPipelinePublishers: - *Zenoss Events Publisher URL* - &lt;other_event_pipeline_publishers&gt;</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Where the publisher URLs are device-specific, and copied from the     device overview page shown above. For example:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ManagePipeline: true PipelinePublishers: - https://1.2.3.4:8342/ceilometer/v1/samples/myopenstack?verify_ssl=False ManageEventPipeline: true EventPipelinePublishers: - https://1.2.3.4:8342/ceilometer/v1/events/myopenstack?verify_ssl=False</code></p> </li> <li> <p>If desired, multiple publisher URLs may be specified, for instance     to publish to more than one zenoss instance, or to other openstack     systems such as gnocchi or panko. Note, however, that ceilometer     will publish data to every publisher sequentially, so if one of the     URLs is timing out, it will block ceilometer and slow down the     publishing of data to Zenoss. Therefore, it is advisable to make     sure that the URLs specified are valid and functioning.</p> </li> <li> <p>This template must be rendered into your templates before you     initiate a deployment from Undercloud.     For more information on RHOSP template management, see RedHat\u2019s     Including Environment Files in Overcloud Creation.</p> </li> <li> <p>After deployment is complete, go to the undercloud, SSH into     controller and go to <code>/etc/ceilometer</code> in     ceilometer_agent_notification container to check if <code>pipeline.yaml</code>     and <code>event_pipeline.yaml</code> file is updated:</p> <pre><code> ssh heat-admin@&lt;controller ip&gt; sudo su - sudo docker exec --user 0 -it ceilometer_agent_notification /bin/bash # Ensure your configuration had the right publishers\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Add Zenoss specific extensions to the Ceilometer event definitions:</p> <p>Edit <code>/etc/ceilometer/event_definitions.yaml</code> and add the contents of zenoss_additions.yaml to the bottom of the file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Restart the ceilometer-notification service on all controller nodes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manual Configuration</p> </li> <li> <p>When RedHat OpenStack Platform is not being used, you will need to     update the affected configuration files directly. The following     modifications are required on every controller node where ceilometer     is running:</p> </li> <li> <p>Add Zenoss specific extensions to the Ceilometer event definitions:</p> <p>Edit <code>/etc/ceilometer/event_definitions.yaml</code> and add the contents of zenoss_additions.yaml to the bottom of the file.</p> </li> <li> <p>The /etc/ceilometer/event_pipeline.yaml file contains one sink,     named <code>event_sink</code>.

(This step is optional, but recommended.) Add the     following settings to <code>/etc/nova/nova.conf</code> on all compute nodes:</p> <pre><code>[notifications] notify_on_state_change=vm_and_task_state [oslo_messaging_notifications] driver = messagingv2\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Configure neutron to send events for ceilometer to forward to     zenoss.

Note     that this option requires that your browser have https connectivity     to the Zenoss collector.</p> </li> <li> <p>General Notes</p> </li> <li> <p>In prior versions of this zenpack, all events from ceilometer were     forwarded to zenoss under /OpenStack. Since most events were not     actionable, they were used to update the model (for instance, a new     instance is created), but were immedaitely archived. In version     3.0.0, these events are still used for incremental model updates,     but are not stored in zenoss as events any more (since they placed     additional load on zenoss for no benefit).</p> <p>If there is a ceilometer event type which is actually useful to track in zenoss as an event, that capability still exists, however. The list of event types to be exposed to zenoss are configurable in <code>zOpenStackProcessEventTypes</code>.</p> <p>By default, this only contains <code>compute.instance.create.error</code>, but other types may be added if desired.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Instance metrics for Disk IO Rate are deprecated in OpenStack     version Queens and later. Collection for those metrics will be     missing. Future OpenStack releases will remove these metrics and     graphs completely.</p> <p>In the meantime, if you still require these metrics, you can edit the OpenStack Ceilometer configuration /etc/ceilometer/polling.yaml and add the following to the meters section:</p> <pre><code> - disk.read.bytes - disk.read.requests - disk.write.bytes - disk.write.requests\n</code></pre> <p>After editing this file, ensure the resulting YAML syntax is valid and restart the ceilometer-polling service.</p> <p>Finally, note that these metrics ARE deprecated and will be removed in future releases of OpenStack itself.</p> </li> <li> <p>The OpenStack ZenPack relies upon standard zenoss Linux Monitoring     for some functions, including process monitoring and the modeling of     vNICs. This means that the Zenoss collectors require SSH access to     the NovaHost devices. In some OpenStack deployments (including     RHOSP\u2019s overcloud), external SSH access may not be available by     default, and additional configuration may be required to achieve it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Zenoss Analytics</p> </li> <li> <p>This ZenPack provides additional support for Zenoss Analytics.

The OpenStackInfrastructure     zenpack is able to integrate with the following ZenPacks to provide     component-level linkage and impact model integration:</p> </li> <li> <p>Neutron OpenvSwitch ml2 plugin &lt;-&gt;     OpenvSwitch     ZenPack</p> </li> <li> <p>Neutron APIC ml2 plugin &lt;-&gt; Cisco APIC ZenPack</p> </li> <li> <p>Neutron NSX ml2 plugin &lt;-&gt; VMWare NSX ZenPack</p> </li> <li> <p>Cinder LVM logical volumes &lt;-&gt; Linux Monitor ZenPack     (&gt;= 2.0.0)</p> </li> <li> <p>Ceph RBD volumes &lt;-&gt;     Ceph ZenPack</p> </li> <li> <p>Known Issues</p> </li> <li> <p>ZEN-17905:     Nova APIs component: Grey icons for Enabled and State after     model/monitor.</p> <ul> <li>OpenStack nova service API does not provide information about     Nova-API, so its status is, in fact, unknown.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>ZPS-1762:     When using OpenvSwitch integration, the Linux devices must be added     to the system first (normally through automatic discovery by the     OpenStackInfrastructure ZenPack) before the corresponding     OpenvSwitch devices are registered. This is because the two devices     use the same management IP address, and a special exclusion is in     place for OpenvSwitch devices, allowing them to be added after the     Linux device, but not the other way around.</p> </li> <li> <p>ZPS-2004:     When adding an OSI device, if the same host is already added as a     generic device (such as /SSH/Linux), the host device\u2019s device class     will be changed, and an error generated, preventing modeling. As a     workaround, remove the Linux device before adding the OSI device.</p> </li> <li> <p>ZPS-4742:     Networking functions through SR-IOV and OVS-DPDK used in NFV like     setups are not supported. Ceilometer is not able to collect     monitoring data for these interfaces and hence Zenoss doesn\u2019t have     any insight into these interfaces. This is because legacy Ceilometer     only supports traditional OpenvSwitch networking, where a TAP     interface is created through libvirt.</p> </li> <li> <p>ZPS-5468:     Newly deployed RabbitMQ-Ceilometer service can fail to start, with     an error <code>badmatch,{error,{no_such_vhost,&lt;&lt;\"/\"&gt;&gt;}}</code>. When this     occurs, all health checks for the service will fail.</p> <p>If this error is encountered, the simplest fix seems to be to attach to the affected container, then run:</p> <pre><code> rm -rf /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia*/rabbit@rbt-ceil0\n</code></pre> <p>and restart the service.</p> </li> <li> <p>ZPS-4689:     During upgrades you can see an error like:</p> <pre><code> ERRO[0000] Could not update proxy\n</code></pre> <p>You can safely ignore this error, which should stop after the upgrade is completed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Changes</p> </li> <li> <p>3.0.1</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for Twisted library update (ZPS-6975)</p> </li> <li> <p>Tested with Zenoss Resource Manager 6.4.1, Zenoss Cloud and Service     Impact 5.5.1</p> </li> <li> <p>3.0.0</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for Keystone Domains (ZPS-3850)</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for Pike, Rocky, Queens, RHOSP 13-14 versions of     OpenStack</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for multiple Zenoss instances (ZPS-1598)</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for restricted (non-administrator) users (ZPS-3851,     ZPS-5043)</p> </li> <li> <p>Exclude erroneous \u2018hostgroup\u2019 host components (ZPS-4914)</p> </li> <li> <p>Fix KeyError in PerfAMQPDataSource vNIC discovery (ZPS-4661)</p> </li> <li> <p>Guard against missing tenant quota.

Since most events were not     actionable, they were used to update the model (for instance, a new     instance is created), but were immedaitely archived. In version     3.0.0, these events are still used for incremental model updates,     but are not stored in zenoss as events any more (since they placed     additional load on zenoss for no benefit).</p> <p>If there is a ceilometer event type which is actually useful to track in zenoss as an event, that capability still exists, however. The list of event types to be exposed to zenoss are configurable in <code>zOpenStackProcessEventTypes</code>.</p> <p>By default, this only contains <code>compute.instance.create.error</code>, but other types may be added if desired.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Instance metrics for Disk IO Rate are deprecated in OpenStack     version Queens and later. Collection for those metrics will be     missing. Future OpenStack releases will remove these metrics and     graphs completely.</p> <p>In the meantime, if you still require these metrics, you can edit the OpenStack Ceilometer configuration /etc/ceilometer/polling.yaml and add the following to the meters section:</p> <pre><code> - disk.read.bytes - disk.read.requests - disk.write.bytes - disk.write.requests\n</code></pre> <p>After editing this file, ensure the resulting YAML syntax is valid and restart the ceilometer-polling service.</p> <p>Finally, note that these metrics ARE deprecated and will be removed in future releases of OpenStack itself.</p> </li> <li> <p>The OpenStack ZenPack relies upon standard zenoss Linux Monitoring     for some functions, including process monitoring and the modeling of     vNICs. This means that the Zenoss collectors require SSH access to     the NovaHost devices. In some OpenStack deployments (including     RHOSP\u2019s overcloud), external SSH access may not be available by     default, and additional configuration may be required to achieve it.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"zenoss/OpenStackInfrastructure/zenpack.html#zenoss-analytics","title":"Zenoss Analytics","text":"<p>This ZenPack provides additional support for Zenoss Analytics.

When a Swift proxy server     updates an object it attempts to synchronously update the object's     container with the new object information. There is a three second     timeout on this task and if it can't be completed in that time, it     will be put into an asynchronous pending bucket to be executed     later. By trending and thresholding on how many tasks are pending     you can get an early read on cluster performance problems. By     default a maximum threshold of 10 is set on this metric and will     raise a warning severity event in the /Perf/Swift event class when     it is breached.</p> <p>Swift Object Server - Disks:   Trend of total and unmounted disks on the storage node. Swift's     mechanism for detecting failing or failed drives and taking them     offline is to unmount them. By proactively monitoring for unmounted     disks and replacing them you can keep your cluster healthy. By     default a maximum threshold of 0 is set on unmounted disks and will     raise a warning severity event in the /Status/Swift event class.</p> Swift Object Server - Quarantine:   Trend of accounts, containers and objects that have been quarantined. Swift has an auditor process that will find corrupt items and move them into a quarantine area so good objects will be replicated back into their place. Sudden increases in quarantined items can indicate hardware problems on storage nodes. Additionally quarantine is not automatically pruned and can result in some storage nodes filling up their disk at a faster rate than others and running out of space. By default a maximum threshold of 100 is set individually on quarantined accounts, containers and objects. A warning event will be raised in the /Status/Swift event class if it is breached. <p>Swift Object Server - Replication Time:   Trend of replication time. Swift has a replicator process that     cycles continually. If a single replication cycle takes more than 30     minutes it can reduce the resiliency of the cluster. By default a     maximum threshold of 30 minutes is set on replication time and will     raise a warning severity event in the /Perf/Swift event class when     breached.</p> <p>Swift Object Server - Load Averages:   Trend of 1, 5 and 15 minute operating system load average.     Additionally the 15 minute load average divided by total disks is     calculated. A perfectly efficient storage node will run at a load     average of 1.0 per disk. By default a maximum treshold of 2.0 is set     on 15 minute load average divided by total disks and will raise a     warning severity event in the /Perf/Swift event class when breached.</p> <p>Swift Object Server - Process Churn:   Trend of processes created per second. High process churn can     indicate a broken process being unnecessarily restarted. By default     a maximum treshold of 100 processes per second is set and will raise     a warning severity event in the /Perf/Swift event class when     breached.</p> <p>Swift Object Server - Disk Usages:   Trend of maximum, average and minimum disk usage for all disks in     the storage node. These are the primary storage capacity metrics     within a cluster. Depending on the size of each individual disk,     weights and the skew of store object sizes, an entire cluster can     exceed capacity if a single disk runs out of capacity. By default a     maximum threshold is set on the maximum usage metric. It will raise     a warning severity in the /Status/Swift event class when breached.</p> <p>Swift Object Server - Disk Sizes:   Trend of maximum, average and minimum disk sizes for all disks in     the storage node. Ideally all disks in a storage node will be the     same size unless weights are closely managed. No default thresholds     are set on these metrics.</p> <p>Swift Object Server - Processes:   Trend of total and running processes. No default thresholds are set     on these metrics.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/OpenStackSwift/zenpack.html#process-monitoring","title":"Process Monitoring","text":"<p>All Swift processes will be discovered and monitored based on the process classes listed above.

However, if you have a highly customized Zenoss install, it is possible that some manual steps still may be required to get the OpenVZ ZenPack up and running. This section describes what the OpenVZ ZenPack does \"behind the scenes\" to automatically enable itself, so that you can perform these steps manually if necessary, and also validate that the OpenVZ ZenPack is fully functional in your environment.</p> <p>When the OpenVZ ZenPack is installed, it will automatically add the zenoss.cmd.linux.OpenVZ modeler plugin to the device classes /Server/Linux and /Server/SSH/Linux. The modeler plugin is the heart of the OpenVZ ZenPack, and is what connects to your Linux system and determines if OpenVZ is running, and if so will model the containers on the system as components which appear under the OpenVZ Containers components list. If for some reason you are using different device classes for Linux devices than those for which the OpenVZ ZenPack automatically is enabled, you will need to manually add zenoss.cmd.linux.OpenVZ as one of the modeler plugins for the device classes you are using.</p> <p>Once the zenoss.cmd.linux.OpenVZ modeling plugin is enabled, it will connect to OpenVZ host devices and determine if they in fact have OpenVZ enabled. If OpenVZ is detected, the modeling plugin will automatically bind the OpenVZHost monitoring template to the OpenVZ Host device. In addition, each container detected on the device will automatically have the OpenVZContainer monitoring template bound to it. These monitoring templates run once every few minutes to collect new RRD metrics and utilization information. You will see charts under each Container listed under OpenVZ Containers, and as you might guess these metrics are collected by the OpenVZContainer monitoring template. In addition, you will see a new graph called OpenVZ Container Memory Utilization under the OpenVZ host device's Graph list, and RRD data for this graph is collected/calculated by the OpenVZHost monitoring template. The OpenVZHost monitoring template will also fire events when a new container is created, a container is destroyed, or there is another type of status change for a container such as it being started, stopped or suspended.</p> <p>Please ensure that all the provided functionality in the OpenVZ ZenPack is being enabled. If not, you should now know where to look for troubleshooting purposes.

An element is a part of a web page, which can be seen by looking at the web page source. The verify Element value can be a HTML tag name, tag 'id' attribute value, HTML DOM XPath, or tag class value. If content validation is desired, the \"Verify Element\" will be a required field while the remaining verify fields are not all required.</p> <p>Web Transaction recipes that interact with an element (e.g. filling an input box, clicking) follow the same logic as \"Verify Element\".</p> <p>Recipe fields that define a \"Value\" to be verified, can also use zProperty or cProperty fields (e.g. <code>${here/cWebTransactionPassword}</code>). This is especially useful for password type values or re-use of monitoring templates by not hardcoding values into the template.</p> <p>NOTE: Transaction validation does not include SSL certificate validation.

A Custom recipe is basically using the special methods in a python script. These methods are special in that they combine and/or enhance the basic capability provided by the selenium-python driver.</p> <p>Before any Custom Recipe script is performed, the maximum wait time for a web page to load is set to the \"zPageLoadTimeout\" value and a <code>driver.get()</code> is performed on the URL defined in the datasource configuration. The defined custom recipe actions are then performed.</p> <p>ZenPack provided methods:</p> <ul> <li>findElement - Find the first matching element in the HTML DOM.     Search by tag name, tag 'id' attribute value, XPath, tag class.     Timeout to find element, defined in the \"zFindElementTimeout\"     property (default value is 10). Elements can be interacted with in     a number of ways; click(), send_keys(), etc.     (Reference: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/interactions/)</li> <li>verifyElement - uses \"findElement\" and then verifies one or     both of element's text or attribute value. Some element values do     change dynamically after initial page load and this method will wait     to match desired result. Timeout to match element's value is defined     in the \"zVerifyElementValueTimeout\" property (default is 10     seconds).</li> <li>clickElement - uses \"findElement\" and then waits until the     element is clickable. The click wait re-uses the timeout defined in     the \"zFindElementTimeout\" property.</li> </ul> <p>Exposed Selenium-python Objects/Methods:</p> <ul> <li>driver - selenium web driver. The above methods should provide     all the functionality required for a Web Transaction test. But if     they do not, the selenium-python webdriver is exposed here.

Typically the default values for these options are appropriate and don't need to be adjusted.</p> <p>blockingwarning:   The zenpython collector daemon executes plugin code provided by     other ZenPacks. If this plugin code blocks for too long it will     prevent zenpython from performing other tasks including collecting     other datasources while the plugin code is executed. The     blockingwarning option will cause zenpython to log a warning for     any plugin code that blocks for the configured number of seconds or     more. The default value is 3 seconds. Decimal precision such as 3.5     can be used.</p> blockingtimeout:   See blockingwarning. This option will cause zenpython to disable a plugin if it blocks for longer than the number of seconds specified. The zenpython daemon will restart itself after disabling the plugin to get unblocked. Events will be created indicating that some monitoring will not be performed due to disabled plugins on all affected devices. The default value is 30 seconds. Decimal precision such as 5.5 can be used. A blocking plugin likely indicates a problem with the way the plugin was written. The author of the plugin should be contacted if this is seen. Zenoss support should be contacted if the plugin came from Zenoss. Once a plugin is blocked, it will remain permanently blocked until its name is removed from either /var/zenoss/zenpython.blocked on Zenoss Cloud and Zenoss 6, or /opt/zenoss/var/zenpython.blocked on Zenoss 4. The zenpython service must be restarted after manual modifications to this file. Setting this value to 0 disables the blocking feature and enables previously blocked plugins. <p>runningtimeout:   Timeout datasource collection that exceeds (runningtimeout *     cycletime) seconds. The default value is 3 cycles. Decimal precision     such as 3.5 can be used. A 0 value will disable datasource timeouts     as was the case in PythonCollector versions earlier than 1.10.0.</p> <p>twistedthreadpoolsize:   Controls size of threads pool. Datasources can use multi-threading     to run multiple requests in parallel. Increasing this value may     boost performance at the cost of system memory used. The default     value is 10.</p> <p>twistedconcurrenthttp:   Controls the number of total concurrent HTTP connections to be     permitted by the twisted.web.client.getPage function.</p> <p>collect:   Allows only specific plugins to run. This is primarily a developer     option to help reduce the noise while developing plugins. The     default is to collect all configured plugins. The value for this     option is a regular expression. Only plugins which class name     matches the regular expression will be run.</p> <p>ignore:   Prevents specific plugins from running. This is primarily a     developer option to help reduce the noise while developing plugins.     The default is to not ignore any configured plugins. The value for     this option is a regular expression. Only plugins which class name     doesn't match the regular expression will be run.</p> <p>datasource:   Collects only the specified datasource.

The COMMAND data source type is infinitely flexible, but because of the shell and subprocess spawning, it's performance and ability to pass data into the collection script are limited. The Python data source type circumvents the need to spawn subprocesses by forcing the collection code to be asynchronous using the Twisted library. It circumvents the problem with passing data into the collection logic by being able to pass any basic Python data type without the need to worry about shell escaping issues.</p> <p>The Python data source type is intended to be used in one of two ways. The first way is directly through the creation of Python data sources through the web interface or in a ZenPack. When used in this way, it is the responsibility of the data source creator to implement the required Python class specified in the data source's Python Class Name property field. The second way the Python data source can be used is as a base class for another data source type.

This almost always means the root user. See the Using a Non-Root User section below for instructions on allowing non-root users to run rabbitmqctl. To do this you need to set the following zProperties for the RabbitMQ devices or their device class in Zenoss.</p> <ul> <li>zCommandUsername</li> <li>zCommandPassword</li> <li>zKeyPath</li> </ul> <p>The zCommandUsername property must be set. To use public key authentication you must verify that the public portion of the key referenced in zKeyPath is installed in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the appropriate user on the RabbitMQ server. If this key has a passphrase you should set it in the zCommandPassword property. If you'd rather use password authentication than setup keys, simply put the user's password in the zCommandPassword property.</p> <p>You should then add the zenoss.ssh.RabbitMQ modeler plugin to the device, or device class containing your RabbitMQ servers and remodel the device(s). This will automatically find the node, vhosts, exchanges and queues and begin monitoring them immediately for the following metrics.</p>  Node Values  <ul> <li>Status - Running or not?

The first property allows you to control the number of components which WBEM ZenPack will get during the monitoring/modeling per one request. For example, you have 5000 volumes, 2000 hard disk, etc. on a target system. Without configuring <code>zWBEMMaxObjectCount</code> property, ZenPack will try to get data for all components as one big response. WBEM server may not be able to process such a big request due to performance reasons or transfer response due to network issues. To avoid that you can modify a value of <code>zWBEMMaxObjectCount</code> for example to 200, ZenPack will get data in smaller chunks by 200 components in each response. Also, you can adjust <code>zWBEMOperationTimeout</code> property with a time in seconds which the WBEM Server keeps enumeration session opened after a previous request and based on that time server will close the session.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/WBEM/zenpack.html#no-data-for-components-with-same-identifiers","title":"No data for components with same identifiers","text":"<p>For example, you have two hard disks with same identifiers but on different arrays, and you set Result Component Key to attribute or column name that contains the component name in the result.

Using a combination of JConsole (Oracle's JMX client that is shipped with the JDK) and JMX, a system operator can examine the number of threads that are active in the JVM or change the log level. There are numerous other performance metrics that can be gleaned from the JVM, as well as several management interfaces that can be invoked that change the behavior of the JVM.</p> <p>In Java 5, Oracle introduced the Remote API for Java Management Extensions. This enhancement defines an RMI wrapper around a JMX agent and allows for independent client development. The zenjmx daemon accesses remote JMX agents via the Remote API for Java Management Extensions. It currently does not support local connections (provided via the temporary directory) to JMX Agents. JMX also specifies the manner in which various protocols can be used to connect to clients, and send and receive information. The original, most commonly used protocol is RMI. The zenjmx daemon supports RMI and JMXMP connections.</p>"},{"location":"zenoss/ZenJMX/zenpack.html#zenjmx-capabilities","title":"ZenJMX Capabilities","text":"<p>The zenjmx daemon is a full-featured JMX client that works \"out of the box\" with JMX agents that have their remote APIs enabled. It supports authenticated and unauthenticated connections, and it can retrieve single-value attributes, complex-value attributes, and the results of invoking an operation. Operations with parameters are also supported so long as the parameters are primitive types (Strings, booleans, numbers), as well as the object version of primitives (such as <code>java.lang.Integer</code> and <code>java.lang.Float</code>). Multi-value responses from operations (Maps and Lists) are supported, as are primitive responses from operations.</p> <p>The <code>JMX</code> data source installed by this ZenPack allows you to define the connection, authentication, and retrieval information you want to use to retrieve performance information. The IP address is extracted from the parent device, but the port number of the JMX Agent is configurable in each data source. This allows you to operate multiple JMX Agents on a single device and retrieve performance information for each agent separately. This is commonly used on production servers that run multiple applications.</p> <p>Authentication information is also associated with each JMX data source. This offers the most flexibility for site administrators because they can run some JMX agents in an open, unauthenticated fashion and others in a hardened and authenticated fashion. SSL-wrapped connections are supported by the underlying JMX Remote subsystem built into the JDK, but were not tested in the Zenoss labs. As a result, your success with SSL encrypted access to JMX Agents may vary.</p> <p>The data source allows you to define the type of performance information you want to achieve: single-value attribute, complex-value attribute, or operation invocation. To specify the type of retrieval, you must specify an attribute name (and one or more data points) or provide operation information.</p> <p>Any numerical value returned by a JMX agent can be retrieved by Zenoss platform and graphed and checked against thresholds. Non-numerical values (Strings and complex types) cannot be retrieved and stored by Zenoss platform.</p> <p>When setting up data points, make sure you understand the semantics of the attribute name and choose the correct Zenoss platform data point type. Many JMX Agent implementations use inconsistent nomenclature when describing attributes. In some cases the term \"Count\" refers to an ever-increasing number (a \"Counter\" data point type).

You should consult with your application server for specific instructions. This section includes instructions for a few commonly used configurations.</p> <p>JMX agents can be configured in two ways: remote access and local-only. When configured for remote access a JMX client communicates with the JMX agent via a socket and uses a remote protocol such as Remote Method Invocation (RMI) or JMXMP to access the MBeans. When configured for local-only access the JMX agent periodically dumps serialized MBeans to a temporary directory on the machine. JConsole can be used to access JMX agents in local-only mode as well as in remote mode. The zenjmx daemon can be used only with remote servers via RMI or JMXMP and cannot work with local-only serialized MBeans. This is not a significant limitation because the zenjmx daemon can establish RMI connections to localhost in the same manner that it creates connections to remote hosts.</p> <p>The JAVA_OPTS environment variable can be used to enable remote access to JVM MBeans. Set it as follows:</p> <pre><code>JAVA_OPTS=\"-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=12345\"\nJAVA_OPTS=\"${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false\"\nJAVA_OPTS=\"${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false\"\n\nexport JAVA_OPTS\n</code></pre> <p>When starting an application pass the JAVA_OPTS variable as an argument to the JVM as follows:</p> <pre><code>java ${JAVA_OPTS} -classpath /path/to/application.jar com.yourcompany.Main\n</code></pre> <p>You can then use JConsole to connect to localhost:12345. Authentication can be configured by modifying the java.security file as well as java.policy.

If we query for a single metric on that top-level pool, say, memEntitlement, instead of being counted as one metric, it is counted as one per VM in the entire cluster. That is, vSphere is expanding our one query into a bunch of internal queries, and counting them all against the maxQueryMetrics limit described above. In practice, this means that in any cluster that has more than 64 VMs, these three metrics will not be available on that top-level resource pool, because there is no way to query them without them being counted as more than 64 metrics.</p> <p>The same problem applies to all resource pools that contain, directly or through sub-pools, more than 64 VMs.</p> <p>The only workaround is to disable the vpxd.stats.maxQueryMetrics setting on the vSphere side, as described above, or to raise it to a very high number (under current versions of the zenpack, it would need to be a bit more than 3 times the number of VMs in the cluster - future versions will subdivide these queries further so that it only needs to be the number of VMs)</p> <p>Note that there will also be gaps in the \u201cCPU Usage\u201d graph because the Zenoss collector will stop trying to collect any metrics from a given resource pool after it encounters these errors, for 20 minutes by default (configurable via <code>zVSpherePerfRecoveryMinutes</code>). It will then try again, and fail again. Occasional data may get through due to the way Zenoss batches its queries, which can cause partial data to show up on affected resource pools.</p> <p>If you need these graphs to work on these pools, but are unable to raise or disable vpxd.stats.maxQueryMetrics, you may disable the memOverhead, cpuEntitlement, and memEntitlement datapoints in the ResourcePool monitoring template.

This is primarily due to the fact that the time window of data polled in each cycle is now dynamic, and is based on what data has already been collected. Therefore, rather than tuning the specific window as was done in previous versions of the zenpack using the (no longer supported) <code>zVSpherePerfWindowSize</code> option, the collector will automatically collect as much data as is available since the last time it collected each metric.</p> <p>This, in combination with other changes, means that the collector is better able to compensate for large vCenter installations or slow response times.</p> <p>However, a number of configuration variables are still available for advanced tuning:</p> <ul> <li><code>zVSpherePerfDelayCollectionMinutes</code>: If set, will cause collection     to be delayed by the specified number of minutes. This may be useful     if the most recent data value for each counter is untrustworthy, for     instance. The collector will already handle a known case where the     most recent data value may show up as a \u20180\u2019 erroneously without the     use of this option, so it would only be used if some other similar,     but unanticipated problem occurred. This is a very safe option to     experiment with, with the only side effect being delayed data on the     graphs.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfMaxAgeMinutes</code>: An upper limit on how far back Zenoss     will query vSphere for performance data. It is highly recommended     not to change this value, as it reflects VMware\u2019s recommendation to     only query within the last 30 minutes.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfRecoveryMinutes</code>: When an error occurs in querying a     specific metric, it is \u201cblacklisted\u201d for this number of minutes     before it is retried. This avoids repeated errors due to attempts to     query a metric that is not working properly. The default is to wait     20 minutes, and it may be lowered if desired. Lowering it is not     particularly beneficial though, since the data that was missed     during this gap will normally be retroactively filled in if it     starts working again within that 20-minute window.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfTimeoutRecoveryMinutes</code>: When a timeout error occurs in     querying a specific metric, it is \u201cblacklisted\u201d for this number of     minutes before it is retried. This avoids repeated errors due to     attempts to query a metric that is not working properly. The default     is fairly long (1 hour), and it can be safely lowered if desired or     if gaps appear in the graphs.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfParallelQueries</code>: How many queries to execute against     vCenter in parallel. The default is 8, but it may be lowered if this     is putting excessive load on vCenter, or raised if doing so     increases throughput.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfQueryTimeout</code>: How long to allow each API call to     respond. When a timeout or other error occurs, the metrics in that     query will be divided in half and each half retried, and if a     specific metric persistently times out or produces an error, it will     be blacklisted as described under <code>zVSpherePerfRecoveryMinutes</code>. The     default value for this property is 25 seconds.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfQueryChunkSize</code>: The maximum number of metrics to     include in each query for managed objects for which we normally use     the \u2018raw data feed\u2019 query option (data stored on the ESX hosts):     Hosts, LUNs, pNICs, VMs</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfQueryVcChunkSize</code>: The maximum number of metrics to     include in each query for managed objects for which we normally use     the \u20185-minute\u2019 query option (data stored in the vCenter database):     Clusters, Datastores, ResourcePools. The default is 64, but it may     be lowered or raised, depending on the needs of the environment. The     collector automatically adjusts the number of metrics to request by     splitting the request in half if the query fails. However, if the     request consistently fails, starting with a lower chunk size will     allow the collector to skip these adjustments, reducing the total     number of queries required.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfQueryRaw20</code>: Whether to actually use the \u2018raw data     feed\u2019 query option for the managed object types it is normally used     for: Hosts, LUNs, pNICs, VMs. Setting this to False will cause the     less efficient \u20185-minute\u2019 query option to be used, but could be     useful if there is a problem with the raw data feed.</li> <li><code>zVSpherePerfQueryVcRaw20</code>: Whether to actually use the \u2018raw data     feed\u2019 query option for the managed object types is not normally used     for: Datacenters, Clusters, Resource Pools. It is not recommended to     change this value from its default of False.</li> </ul> <p>When adjusting the chunk sizes, there may be tradeoffs to values that are too large or too small. On systems with large numbers of datastores and resource pools or vApps, it may be beneficial to raise <code>zVSpherePerfQueryVcChunkSize</code>. However, if vSphere 6.x is being used, <code>zVSpherePerfQueryVcChunkSize</code> must be 64 or less. This restriction can be lifted if vpxd.stats.maxQueryMetrics, an advanced vCenter configuration property, is also adjusted, as described at http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2107096</p> <p>NOTE: As of version 3.3 of the vSphere ZenPack, the <code>zVSpherePerfWindowSize</code> configuration property is no longer used, and the meaning <code>zVSpherePerfQueryChunkSize</code> has been changed slightly. It used to describe a number of query specifications (groups of metrics on a specific entity), and now it describes the number of metrics instead.

There is generally no benefit to using this caching feature where it is not needed, but no major downside either, other than increased memory usage on the collector. Should you find a property where this caching is needed, please notify Zenoss so that we may make this behavior the default in future versions of this ZenPack.</p> <p>Advanced tuning of modeling to accommodate the addition of very large vSphere instances to Zenoss, which may otherwise time out during their initial modeling may be performed using the <code>zVSphereModelMpLevel</code>, <code>zVSphereModelMpObjs</code>, <code>zVSphereModelMpIndexObjs</code>, and <code>zVSphereModelAdmSoftLimit</code> variables.

If this problem is occurring, the error <code>HTTP transport error: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake</code> will be found in the zenvsphere.log.</p> <p>To correct it, either update ESXi to 5.5 build 4722766 or later, or edit the zenvsphere.conf file and set the following option:</p> <pre><code>vmargs -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1\n</code></pre> <p>Note that setting this option, may have negative side effects, so it should only be used when necessary. In particular, it will prevent zenvsphere from being able to collect to newer versions of VMware, which have disabled TLSv1 support in favor of TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. See https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2145796 for a detailed breakdown of which versions of VMware have had TLSv1 support disabled. There are options (described in the KB article) to re-enable it if required.</p> <p>A similar issue may occur with Zenoss 4.2.5 through 5.1.x when attempting to monitor a version of VMware newer than 6.5. Again, it will manifest as an <code>HTTP transport error: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake</code> error.
